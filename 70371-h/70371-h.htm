<h2 class="nobreak">TO THE READER</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> readers of “Jean-Christophe” certainly never expected
this new volume, but they cannot be more surprised
than I am myself. I had sketched out other
works,—a play and a novel on subjects of the day,
in somewhat the same tragic key as “Jean-Christophe,”
but I had to break off abruptly, throwing aside all
my notes and well-planned scenes, for this trifling
work which only came into my head the day before.
This book is a reaction from the constraint of
“Jean-Christophe,” which, like an outgrown cuirass,
fitted well enough at first, but had become too tight for
me; I felt an absolute need of something gay, in the
true Gallic spirit—even perhaps verging on impropriety.</p>

<p>On returning to my native place for the first time since
my youth, the renewed contact with the soil of Burgundy
woke a past within me which I had believed silent forever;
and roused all the Colas Breugnons under my skin,
so that I was forced to speak for them—as if their
tongues had not wagged enough in their lifetime!</p>

<p>They took advantage of the circumstance that one of
their descendants chanced to have the pen of a ready
writer (something that they had always coveted) and
turned me into their secretary. To my protestations,
“Now, Grandad, you had your day, it is my turn to
speak now,” they only answered: “Young one, you can
talk when we have finished. In the first place you have
nothing more interesting to say, so sit down, and listen
with all your ears: you might do that much for the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
man; when you stand where I am now you will know
that silence is the worst of death.”</p>

<p>How could I help writing what was dictated to me?
Now it is all over and I am free again—at least I suppose
so—and can take up the thread of my own thoughts,
if some one of these old chatter-boxes does not take it
into his head to start up from the tomb and impart to
me his message to posterity.</p>

<p>I am afraid that the society of my Colas Breugnon will
not amuse my readers as much as the author; but they
must take the book for what it is; something perfectly
frank and straightforward which has no idea of transforming
or explaining the world either politically, or
metaphysically. He is just a true Frenchman, who laughs
because he is well and hearty and life is sweet to him.</p>

<p>One cannot escape the Maid of Orleans at the beginning
of a French story, so, as she used to say, “Take
kindly to it”!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE AFTER THE WAR</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the War broke out this book was already printed
and ready to appear, so I have left it untouched. The
grandchildren of Colas Breugnon have just emerged as
heroes and victims of a bloody epic, only to show an unquenchable
flame to the world. Let me hope that the
people of Europe, full of courage in spite of their sufferings,
may find some solace in these reflections of “a little
lamb caught between the wolf and the shepherd.”</p>

<small>THE LARK OF CANDLEMAS-DAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Thanks</span> be to St. Martin, business is bad, so there
is no use in breaking one’s back; and Lord knows
I have worked hard enough in my time to take a
little rest and comfort here at my table, with a
bottle of wine on my right hand, the ink-well on
the left, and a new quire of paper before me.</p>

<p>“Your good health, old boy!” I say to myself,
“I am to have a talk with you now.” Downstairs
I can hear my wife raging while the wind roars
outside and I am told there are threatenings of
war. Well, let them be!—How jolly it is to be alone
face to face with the best fellow in the world (I am
talking of course of my other self, of you, Colas,
with your old red phiz, and queer grin, with your
long Burgundian nose all askew like a hat on one
ear). Tell me if you can why it is so good to see
you like this, just our two selves; to look closely
at your elderly countenance, touching lightly, as it
were, on the wrinkles, and to drink a bumper of old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
remembrance from the bottom of my heart which
is like a deep well, worse luck! It is pleasant
enough to dream, but still better to pin one’s dreams
down to paper! However, I am no visionary,
but wide-awake, full of fun and clear-sighted, with
no idle fancies in my head. I only tell what I have
seen, done, and said; and for whom do I write?
Certainly not for fame; for I am no fool, and know
what I amount to, the Lord be praised!</p>

<p>I write for my grandchildren? Little will be
left of all my scribblings in ten years, as the old
woman is jealous of them, and burns whatever she
can lay hands on. For whom, then? Why, for
my other self, of course, for our good pleasure.—I
am sure I should burst if I did not write! Truly
I am not for nothing the child of my grandfather,
who could not sleep unless he had put down on
the edge of his pillow the number of flagons he had
emptied. I feel I must talk, and here in Clamecy
I have had my fill of word contests. I must break
loose, like the fellow who shaved King Midas. I
know my tongue runs away with me; and it would
be at the risk of my neck if I were heard; but
what’s the odds! without its dangers life would be
flat enough. I am like our big white oxen, and
love to chew the cud of the day’s food. How good
it is to taste, feel, and handle all one has thought,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
observed, or picked up; to smack one’s lips, to
relish, as one tells it over to one’s self, something
one snapped up hastily—it seems to melt in one’s
mouth, and slip down softly; and how good it is to
glance around one’s little world and say, “All this
is mine, here I am lord and master, no frost or cold
can nip me; here reigns no king, no pope! Not
even my old shrew!” But now I must take an
account of this world of mine.</p>

<p>The first and best of my possessions is myself.
Colas Breugnon, a good Burgundian, plain and
straightforward, with a well-rounded waistcoat. I
am not exactly in my first youth—fifty last birthday,—but
well set-up, my teeth still good, and my
sight as clear as a fish’s. My beard still sprouts
vigorously, but is undoubtedly grayish, and I
can’t help regretting the fair hair of my youth,
and would not say no, if you offered to set my clock
back twenty or thirty years. But after all ten lusters
are a fine thing. The youngsters may laugh,
but how many of them could have paraded up and
down France as I have done, for all these years?
Lord! how much sun and rain have hit this old
back! I have been roasted, soaked, and warmed
over dozens of times and my body, like a cracked
leather sack, is full of joy and sorrow, spite and
good-humor, wisdom and folly, hay and straw, figs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
and grapes, fruit ripe and unripe, roses and haws—what
I have seen, felt and known, owned and lived,
all jumbled together in the game-bag, and what
fun to dive into it;—but hold on, Colas! We will
go into that tomorrow, we shall never be done if
we take it up today, so just now we will draw up
the inventory of all property belonging to me.</p>

<p>I own a house, a wife, four boys, and a girl
(thank God she is married!), eighteen grandchildren,
a gray donkey, a dog, six hens, and a pig.—So,
I may be called rich. I want to look closely at
these treasures, so I must put on my glasses, for, to
tell the truth, the latter items exist only in memory.
Wars have swept over them, soldiers of the enemy
and friends too, so the pig was long ago salted
down, the ass foundered, the cellar emptied, and
the fowls plucked. I have the wife still, by
Heavens! It is not easy to forget my happiness
when I hear that squalling tongue,—she’s a fine
old bird, and mine to the last feather. The whole
town envies Breugnon, the old scamp. Come on
then, gentlemen, speak up, if you would like to have
her! She is a saving, active, sober, good woman,
with all the virtues, but they do not seem to fatten
her, and I must confess, fellow-sinner, that I like
one plump little frailty better than all the seven
bony virtues. Well, since it is the will of God,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
let us be good for lack of something better. Hear
her rushing about; her bones seem to be everywhere.
She goes poking and climbing, sulking,
scolding, grumbling, growling from garret to cellar;
dirt and tranquillity flee at her approach.
Nearly thirty years ago we were married. Devil
take me if I know why! I was smitten with another
girl who jilted me, and my wife doted on me because
I cared nothing for her. At that time she
was small, dark and pale, with hard bright eyes
which seemed to eat into me as two drops of acid
burn steel; but she loved and <i>loved</i> me fit to kill
herself! Men are such fools, that by dint of running
after me (through pity, vanity too, because
I was tired of it all, and because I wanted to get rid
of her; a fine way I took to do it!) I became her
husband; Johnnie the fool, who kept out of the rain
when he jumped in the pool. Ever since, she and
all the cardinal virtues dwell in my house, but she
would like to get even with me, sweet creature that
she is! to make up for the love she threw at me. She
wants to stir me up; but it can’t be done, I like my
ease too much, and I am not such a fool as to make
myself unhappy for a word more or less. Let the
rain come down, my voice echoes the thunder and
I only laugh when she screams. Why shouldn’t
she scream if she likes it? Why should I keep a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
woman from such a simple pleasure when I do
not want to kill her? Women and silence do not
dwell together; so let her sing her song, and I will
sing mine. As long as she does not try to shut my
mouth (and she will not attempt that, if she is
wise) she may warble as she likes, each to his own
music.</p>

<p>We may not have been exactly in tune, but none
the less we played some pretty pieces together; a
girl and four boys, all good and well-built regardless
of expense, but of the lot the only one in whom
I see my own flesh is my girl, Martine, the little
witch! What a time I had with her before I got
her safely married! She has settled down now,
though I don’t count too much on it, but it is no
longer my business to look after her and trot about
at her heels; my son-in-law can take his turn. She
and I always wrangle whenever we meet, but at
bottom we understand each other as no one else
does; she is a good sort, cautious even when she
seems most reckless, good too, if there is fun in it;
for boredom is to her worse than wickedness. She
does not mind trouble, for that means effort, which
is joy, and she loves life and has an eye for what is
good. My blood runs in her veins, the only trouble
is I gave her too much of it.</p>

<p>The boys are not quite so successful. There was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
an undue share of the mother in them and the
dough did not rise; two out of the four are bigots
like her, and what is worse their bigotries are
antagonistic, for one is always running after priests’
skirts, while the other is a Huguenot. I cannot
think how I came to hatch out such a couple of
ducks. My third son is a soldier, and has to fight,
when he is not loafing about, God knows where! and
the fourth is just a nonentity; a little sheepish, insignificant
shopkeeper—it makes me yawn to think
of him, but when the whole of us are seated round
the table, each with a fork in his fist, then I feel indeed
that we are all of one breed, all of one mind;
and well worth looking at, our jaws going like
clockwork, bread and wine disappearing down the
trapdoor.</p>

<p>You have heard of the furniture, now let us
talk of the house itself, which is like another
daughter to me, for I built it with my own hands
bit by bit, and some parts over and over again, on
the banks of the Beuvron, which flows along slowly
smooth and green, full of grass, mud and slime, just
where the suburbs begin on the other side of the
bridge which is like a crouching hound with the
water licking below. Directly in front the tower
of St. Martin rises light and proud, its edges like
an embroidered skirt. They tell us the steps leading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
to Paradise are dark and steep; so are those
of Old Rome leading up to the carved doorway.
My shell, my niche is outside the walls, and the
result of that is that when from the top of St.
Martin’s tower they spy an enemy in the plain
the town shuts its gates, and the enemy comes to
me;—I could get along without that sort of visit,
though I like conversation as a general thing. So
I leave the key under the door, and get out, but
when I come back it sometimes happens that both
door and key have disappeared, leaving only the
four walls, and then I have to rebuild. My friends
say to me, “Stupid! to take all this trouble for
the enemy. Come out of your mole-hill into the
town where you will be safe.” But I always answer,
“I know when I am well off. Perhaps I
should be safer behind a thick wall, but what could
I see there? the wall, and nothing else.” That would
bore me to death, for I need elbow room; and I
like to spread myself out along my river bank, and
when I am in my little garden, with nothing to do,
I love to watch the reflections in the still water, the
bubbles the fish make on the surface and the long-tressed
weeds stirring at the bottom. I fish there
too, or even wash my clothes, and empty my pots
in it. Good or bad, here I have always been, it is
too late for me to change; and, after all, nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
can happen worse than what has happened before.
Even if the house is burned down again (for you
never can tell), I do not propose to build for
all eternity, but here where I have taken root it is
not easy to pull me up. I have rebuilt twice, if
necessary I can do it ten times more; not that I
look upon it as an amusement, but it would be
still less amusing to change, and I should be like
a man stripped of his skin; there would be no use
in offering me a fine new white one; I know it
would not fit; it would wrinkle on me or I should
burst it. On the whole I prefer the old one.</p>

<p>Now let us add it all up: Wife, children, house;
have I reckoned up all my goods? I have kept the
best to the last, my trade. I am a carpenter and
woodworker, belonging to the brotherhood of St.
Anne, and when we have a procession I am the one
who carries the staff with the device of a compass
on a lyre, and there you may see God’s
grandmother teaching the little Mary to read, a
Virgin full of grace no bigger than your thumb.
Armed with hatchet, chisel, and auger, with my
plane at hand, I rule over knotted oak and smooth
walnut from my workbench, and the result rests
with me—and with my customer’s pocket. Many
shapes lie hidden there! To rouse Beauty sleeping
in the wood, her lover must penetrate to the heart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
of it, but the loveliness which is unveiled under
my plane has no unrealities. You know those
slim Dianas of the early Italians, straight behind
and before?—a good Burgundy piece is better yet,
bronzed, strong, covered like a grapevine with
fruit; a fine bulging cupboard, a carved wardrobe,
such as Master Hugues Tambin wrought fantastically.
I dress my houses with panels, and moldings,
and winding staircases in long twists and my
furniture is like trained fruit trees, full and robust,
sprouting from the wall, made for the very spot
where I place it. The best of all is when I can
fix on my wood something I see smiling in my
mind’s eye, a gesture, a movement, a bending
back or swelling breast, flowery curves, garlands
and grotesques, or when I catch the face of some
passerby on the wing and pin it to my plank. The
finest thing I ever turned out, the choir stalls in
the Church of Montreal, show two men at table
drinking and laughing with a jug between them,
and two lions snarling over a bone. I did that to
please myself and the vicar. To work after a good
drink, and drink after good work, is my idea of a
fine life!... I see all sorts of useless grumblers
around me; they say I have picked out a queer
time to shout in, that we are in a sad state now;
but no state is sad, there are only dreary people,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
and I am not one of them, the Lord be praised!
Men ill-treat you and rob you?—so it ever shall
be. I would wager my neck that centuries from
now our great-grandnephews will be equally keen
to claw and scratch each other’s eyes. No doubt
they will have thought of forty new ways to do
the trick better than we, but I bet they cannot
find out a new way to drink, and I defy them to do
better in that line than I. Who knows what those
fellows will be up to in four hundred years? The
Curé of Meudon had an herb, the wonderful Pantagruelion;
maybe thanks to that our descendants
will visit the glimpses of the moon, the forge of
the thunder, and the sluices of the rain; perhaps
stay a while in Heaven to sport with the gods.
Good enough! I’ll go with them. Are they not
the fruit of my loins, and seed of my own sowing?
The future is yours, my sons—but I like it better
where I am, it is safer on the whole, and how can
I be sure that wine will be as good in four centuries
from now? My wife reproaches me because
I am too fond of a spree, but I own that I can’t
bear to lose a trick. I take what the gods provide,
good food, good drink, pretty plump pleasures, and
then those soft tender downy things that a man
enjoys in a day dream, that divine do-nothing state
where all things are possible, where you are young,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
handsome, triumphant, with the world at your feet,
and you work miracles, hear the grass grow and
talk with trees, beasts, and gods. There is one old
chum that never goes back on me, my other self,
my friend,—my work. How good it is to stand before
the bench with a tool in my hand and then
saw and cut, plane, shave, curve, put in a peg, file,
twist and turn the strong fine stuff, which resists
yet yields—soft smooth walnut, as soft to my
fingers as fairy flesh; the rosy bodies or brown
limbs of our wood-nymphs which the hatchet has
stripped of their robe. There is no pleasure like
the accurate hand, the clever big fingers which
can turn out the most fragile works of art, no
pleasure like the thought which rules over the
forces of the world, and writes the ordered caprices
of its rich imagination on wood, iron,
and stone. I am king of a magic realm; my
field yields me its flesh, my vine its blood, and
to serve my art the elves of the sap push out the
fair limbs of the trees, lengthen and fatten them
until they are polished fit for my caresses. My
hands are docile workmen, directed by their foreman,
my old brain here, and he plays the game as I
like it, for is he not my servant too? Was ever
man better served than I? I’m a true little king,
and really must drink my majesty’s health, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
of my faithful subjects, for I am not ungrateful.
Blessed be the day when I saw the light! How
many glorious things there are on this round ball,
things which smile at you, and taste sweet. Life is
good, by the Lord! I always hunger for more, no
matter how much I stuff myself; but I am afraid
that I shall make myself sick; sometimes, I give
you my word, my mouth fairly waters before the
feast spread for me by the earth and the sun.</p>

<p>But while I am boasting, old boy, the sun has
gone, and left my little world all chilled. That
beastly old winter has pushed his way into my
very room, so that the pen trembles in my stiff
fingers; there is actually ice in my glass, and my
nose is blue. Detestable color! it makes me think
of graveyards. I hate anything pale.—Hullo, wake
up! St. Martin is ringing his chimes; it is Candlemas
today. “When the days begin to lengthen, the
cold begins to strengthen,” does it indeed? then we
must do likewise, we will go out and meet it face
to face. It is cold, and no mistake; my cheeks
sting with the frost needles, and the north wind
lies in wait at the corner to catch me by the beard,
but I am beginning to warm up, thank the Lord!
and my complexion is once more brilliant. I like
the ring of the hard ground under my feet, it makes
me as merry as a grig, but what ails all these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
folks that they are so pinched and wretched-looking?</p>

<p>“Well, Mrs. Neighbor, what has put you out?
It’s the wind, hey, rumpling up your skirts? I
don’t blame him, young rascal! I wish I were
young myself; he knows the right spot—greedy
scamp! he picks out the toothsome morsels. Have
patience, old girl; live and let live. And where
are you running, as if the devil were after you? To
church? God will always get the better of Satan.
Those who weep will rejoice, and frost will burn.
Now you are laughing yourself? good, good; I am
on the run for church too, yes I am off to Mass like
you, only it will not be said by the Curé,—Mass
in the fields is what I mean.”</p>

<p>I stop at my daughter’s first to get my little
Glodie, for we walk together every day. Best little
friend that she is to me! my lambling, my little
chirping frog, just five years old; as wide-awake
as a mouse and keen as mustard. She comes running
to meet me, for she knows I always have a
lot of new stories for her, it is hard to say which she
loves most;—so we go on hand in hand.</p>

<p>“Come along, darling, to meet the lark.”</p>

<p>“What lark?”</p>

<p>“It is Candlemas. Did you never hear that today
the lark comes back to us out of the skies?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>“What did he do up there?”</p>

<p>“He went to look for fire.”</p>

<p>“What fire?”</p>

<p>“Fire to make sunshine, fire to boil the
kettle.”</p>

<p>“Did the fire fly away then?”</p>

<p>“Why yes, on All Saints’ Day. In November
every year it leaves us to go and warm up the
stars.”</p>

<p>“And how do we get him back again?”</p>

<p>“We send three little birds to fetch him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, do tell me!”</p>

<p>There she is trotting along the road, all warmly
snuggled in a jacket of soft white wool, looking
like a little robin in her red hood. She doesn’t
mind the cold, not she! but her fat cheeks are like
rosy apples, and her little nose runs.</p>

<p>“Ah, this little candle needs the snuffers, is that
because of Candlemas? and the lights in Heaven?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Grandfather, do tell about the three little
birds.”</p>

<p>“Three little birds set off on a journey, three
bold companions; the Wren, the Red-Breast, and
their friend the Lark; Wren, brisk as quicksilver
and proud as Artaban, soon spied a bright spark
floating in the air. He snapped at it, crying, ‘I have
it! I, I, I!’ The others joined in the same cry, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
as Wren flew down he screamed, ‘Fire! I am
burning!’ He rolled the hot morsel from one corner
of his beak to the other, and at last his tongue was
peeling, and he could bear no more, so he spit it
out and hid it under his little wings. Did you
ever notice the red spots, and his frizzled feathers?—Red-Breast
rushed to help him. He seized the
spark of fire and put it carefully on his soft waistcoat,
but the fine waistcoat got red and redder and
poor Red-Breast screamed, ‘Enough—my clothes
are burning.’ Then came the Lark, the brave little
friend, catching the spark which was flying off to
Heaven, and quick, prompt, and swift as an arrow
she fell to the earth; then with her little beak she
buried the bright spark of sunshine in the frozen
ground, and, oh, how glad it was to feel it!” My
story came to an end, and it was Glodie’s turn to
tell one; then when we got outside the town, I took
her on my back as we climbed the hill. The sky is
gray and the snow creaks under our wooden shoes;
the delicate little skeletons of the trees and bushes
are all wadded with white, and the smoke mounts
up straight from the cottage chimneys slow and
blue. There is no sound but the chirp of my little
frog,—but here we are at the top. Below at our feet
lies my town, wrapped about by the lazy Yonne
and the trifling Beuvron, like silver ribbons, covered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
with snow, frozen, chilled and shivering, yet
somehow it warms my heart only to look at the
place.</p>

<p>City of bright reflections and rolling hills, the
soft lines of tilled slopes surround you like the
twisted straw of a nest. The undulations of five or
six ranges of wooded mountains in the distance are
faintly blue like the sea, but it is not the perfidious
element which overthrew Ulysses and his fleet.
Here are no storms, no ambuscades; all is calm,
save that here and there a breath seems to swell the
breast of a hill. From the crest of one wave to the
other, the roads run deliberately straight, leaving,
as it were, a wake behind them, and beyond the
edge of the waters, far away the spires of St.
Marie Madeleine of Vézelay rise like masts. Close
by, in a bend of the Yonne, you can see the rocks
of Basseville sticking up through the underbrush
like boars’ tusks, and in the center of the circle of
hills the town, carelessly adorned, leans over the
water with her gardens, her buildings, her rags,
and her jewels. Here is filth; but here also is the
harmony of her long limbs, and her head crowned
with the pierced tower. You see the snail admires
his shell. The chimes of the church float up from
the valley and their pure voices spread like a crystal
flood through the thin clear air. As I stand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
happily drinking in the music, suddenly a ray of
sunshine breaks through the gray mantle which
hides the sky, and Glodie claps her hands, crying:</p>

<p>“Grandad, I hear him—the lark, the lark!”
Her dear little fresh voice made me laugh as I
kissed her and said:</p>

<p>“I hear him too, my sweet little spring Lark!”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> cellar will soon be empty, for the soldiers
whom our lord the Duke of Nevers sent to defend
us have tapped my last cask, so there is no time
to be lost. I must drink with them. Taken in the
right spirit, I do not object to being ruined, and
it is not by any means the first time, but God send
it may be the last! The soldiers, good fellows
that they are, felt worse than I did when I told
them that the liquor was running low. Some
of my neighbors take such things tragically, but
that is not my way. I have been too often
to the play in the course of my life to be impressed
by clowns. Since I was born into this
world, how many of these masqueraders I have
seen! Swiss, German, Gascons, Lorrainers; all
dogs of war, with harness on their back and arms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
at their side; victual swallowers, hungry hounds,
always ready to devour us fellows. No one can tell
for what they are fighting. Today it is for the
King; tomorrow for the League; now for the
Black-beetles; now for the Protestants; but one
side is as good as another. The best of them is
not worth the powder it would take to shoot them.
What difference does it make to us which robber
ruffles it at court? And as for the way they appeal
to Heaven, ye gods and little fishes! The Lord
is old enough to know what to do. If your hide
itches, scratch yourself. God is not left-handed
that He should need you, and He acts as He
pleases. But the worst of all is when they make
it out that I too must try to pull the wool over His
eyes! With all due reverence, Lord, I can say
without boasting, You and I meet several times in
the twenty-four hours; that is, if the good old
French saying is true, “He who can good wine
afford has a chance to see the Lord!” But these
frauds say something else that would never enter
my head. They say that I know Thee like a
brother; that I am to carry out Thy will; but Thou
wilt do me the justice to admit that if I leave
Heaven in peace I only ask that it will do as much
for me. Each of us has enough to do to keep his
own house in order, Thou in Thy big world, and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
in my little one. Since Thou hast made me free,
Lord, Thou shouldst be free also! But these fools
want me to mix myself up in Thy concerns, to
speak in Thy name, to decide how men are to
take Thy Sacraments, and if they do otherwise, to
declare them my enemies and Thine. Mine indeed!
By no means; I have none; for all men are
my friends. Let them fight, then, if it likes them,
I am out of the game;—that is if they will let me
alone, but that is just what the rascals will not
do. If I will not be the enemy of one of them
they will both set on me, so between two fires I
must be hit. Here goes then! I will get to fighting
myself, for I would rather on the whole be
first anvil and then hammer, than anvil all the
time. I wish some one would tell me why such
brutes came into the world? marauders, politicians,
great nobles, who bleed our France while they
blow her trumpet and stick their fingers in her
pocket. They are not content to devour our own
substance, but they must needs attack the stores of
others. They threaten Germany, cast the eye of
longing on Italy, and even poke their noses into
the harem of the Grand Turk! They would like
to absorb half the earth, they who would not know
enough to grow cabbages on it! Never mind, old
boy, do not let us fret over it, since all is for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
best as it is until the happy day when we can make
it better in the shortest possible time. It is a poor
beast that is of no use, and I heard a story once
about the good Lord;—(Pardon, Almighty, my
head is full of Thee today)—He was walking with
Peter in one of our suburbs, Béyant,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and a woman
sat cooling her heels on her doorstep. She looked
so bored that our Father, out of the goodness of
His heart, drew a hundred fleas from his pocket
and threw them to her, saying, “There is something
to amuse yourself with, my daughter!” The
woman roused herself to see what she could catch,
and every time she caught one of the beasts she
laughed for joy.</p>

<p>Through this same charity, no doubt, Heaven
has bestowed on us those big two-legged beasts
who shear our wool. They keep us busy, so let us
be joyful. Vermin is a sign of health, they say,
(and our masters are certainly vermin), so I say
again, be joyful, my friends, for if that is true no
one is healthier than we are. Let me whisper a
word in your ear; we shall have the best of it if we
are patient; cold and frost, good-for-nothings at
court or in camp, will have their day. They too will
pass, but the good ground remains and we are
there to enrich it. One crop will put all to rights,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
meanwhile let us suck up the bottom of my cask, if
only to make room for the vintage of next year.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>My daughter, Martine, said to me one day, “You
are a braggart. To hear you one would think
that you only work with your mouth, idling, gossiping
like a bell-clapper, yawning, and staring; you
pretend to live only for feasting, and are ready to
drink up the sea; yet really you cannot be happy
one day without work. You want people to think
you are careless, wasteful, and idle as a cock-chafer;
you pretend not to count what goes into your purse
nor what comes out of it, but it would make you
ill if your day was not marked off hour by hour
like a striking clock, and you know to a penny what
you have spent since last Easter, and the man does
not live who ever got ahead of you. Dear old
stupid head, innocent lamb that he is! ‘Three
lambs of Chamoux can put to flight any wolf who
comes in the night.’”</p>

<p>I laughed, but did not answer Madame Saucy-Tongue.
Besides, the child is right, though she
ought not to say so, but a woman only hides what
she knows nothing about. It is true that she understands
me, for did I not make her?</p>

<p>Come, Colas Breugnon, you may as well confess
you commit many follies, but you are not a fool.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
Like every one else, by Jove, you have a simpleton
up your sleeve who shows when you like, but he
is tucked away out of sight when you need a clear
head and free hands. Like all Frenchmen, you
have the sense of reason and order so firmly fixed
in your noddle that you can let yourself go safely.
The only danger is for those poor fools who look
at you with an open mouth and try to imitate you.
Fine speeches, sounding verse, daring projects, are
all enjoyable. They exalt and kindle the soul.
But <i>we</i> only burn up our chips, and leave the big
logs in order on the wood-pile. My reason sits at
ease and looks on at the freaks of my imagination,
and all for my own amusement. The world is my
theater, and without stirring from my seat, I am
the play; I can applaud Matamore or Francatrippa;
I witness tourneys and royal processions,
I shout “At him again!” when a man gets his
head cracked all for our good pleasure, and to add
to it, I pretend to take part in the farce and to believe
in it only just enough to keep up the joke.
No more, you may be sure. That is the way to
listen to fairy tales and not to them only! There
is Some One up there above the clouds for whom
we have a great respect when the procession passes
through our streets with cross and banner, chanting
the <i>Oremus</i>; we drape the walls of our houses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
with white—but between ourselves?—Shut up,
chatterer, you go too far! Be deaf, Lord, to my
folly, and accept my humble service.</p>

<p class="right">The end of February.</p>

<p>An ass having eaten the grass in the meadow,
said, “There is no further need to watch it,” and
so went to eat (I mean watch) in another field
near by. The garrison of the Duke of Nevers left
us today. I was really proud of our cookery when
I looked at them, for they were as fat as seals.
We parted with smiles in our hearts and on our
lips; they with the kindest wishes for the next
season, hoping our crops would be good and our
vines safe from the frost.</p>

<p>“Work hard, dear uncle,” said my guest, the
Sergeant Fiacre Bolacre, (it is his pet name for
me and one which I deserve, for that relation gives
a good ration.) “Go prune your vines, no matter
how much trouble it costs you, and next St. Martin’s
Day we will come back to drink the wine.”
Gallant fellows! Always ready to help an honest
man with his bottle.</p>

<p>Now that they are gone, what a weight is off
our shoulders! The neighbors are carefully uncovering
their little hiding places. They have gone
about for the last few days with long faces complaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
of hunger as if a wolf were gnawing at
their vitals, and now from the straw of the garret,
or the earth of the cellar, they have dug out something
to feed the beast. Those who bewailed their
destitute state the loudest, the worst beggars of
them all, found means to tuck their best wine away
in some corner. I don’t know how it happened,
but scarcely had my guest, Fiacre Bolacre, left me,
(I went with him to the end of the Jews’ quarter,)
when I suddenly remembered a small cask of Chablis
left by mistake under the dunghill in a good
warm place. Of course this upset me dreadfully!
You can easily understand that, but when harm is
done, if it is well done, one must bear it as best
one can, and I bear it well. “Bolacre, my dear
nephew, you don’t know what nectar you have lost,
ah-h! It is not all loss to you though, my good
friend, for here’s your health in it!”</p>

<p>We all began visiting from house to house,
showing what we had found in our cellars, congratulating
each other, and winking like the Roman
Augurs. We spoke also of our injuries and
losses; (losses of our lasses,) and as sometimes the
misfortunes of one’s neighbors are an amusing
consolation, we all inquired solicitously for the
health of Vincent Pluviaut’s wife. (By an extraordinary
chance, after a body of troops has passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
through the town this brave Frenchwoman usually
has to let out her belt.)</p>

<p>We congratulated Pluviaut, and praised him for
his public services in these trying times, and by
way of a joke, meaning no harm, I gave him a
friendly tap, telling him he was lucky to have a
house full now that all the others were empty.
Every one laughed, of course, but not too loud,
just enough to be heard, but Pluviaut did not much
like it, and told me I had better look after my own
wife. “Ah,” said I, “as far as she is concerned I
may sleep in peace. No one is likely to rob me of
my treasure.” And, do you know, they all agreed
with me!</p>

<p>Feast days will soon be upon us, so, though
somewhat short of means, we must live up to our
reputation and that of the town. What would the
world say if Shrove-Tuesday caught Clamecy without
its justly celebrated meat-balls? You can hear
the grease frying, and sniff the delicious fragrance
in the streets. The flapjacks fairly hop from the
pan for my little Glodie! Now the drums go “rub-a-dub,”
and the flutes “twee-wee,” as amid cheers
and shouts the “Gentlemen from Judæa” come on
their car to visit “Rome.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> First appears the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
band; then the halberdiers, and the crowd actually
falls back before the great noses they wear. Some
are shaped like trumpets, or lances, there are
snouts like hunting-horns or pea-shooters, noses
stuck full of spikes, like a chestnut burr, or with a
bird perched on the tip. They hustle the passers-by,
and tickle the ribs of the squealing girls; and
at last comes the Nose King, scattering all before
him like a battering-ram with his great proboscis
which rests on a gun-carriage like a bombard.</p>

<p>Then comes the car of Lent, Emperor of the
Fish-eaters. Their masks are pale green, skinny,
and chilled-looking. They shiver under hoods, or
heads of fishes. One has a perch, or a carp, in
each hand; another brandishes a gudgeon stuck on
a fork; a third wears a hat like a pike’s head, with
a roach dangling from its mouth, and little fishes
falling all around. It is enough to give a man a
surfeit. Some stick their fingers into their jaws and
try to force down eggs too big to swallow. To
right and left, high up on the car, are masks of owls
and monks and fishermen dangling their lines over
the heads of urchins, who jump up like goats to
catch at what may be sweetmeats or perhaps only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
dirt rolled in sugar. Behind is a dancing devil,
dressed like a cook, waving a saucepan and big
spoon. Six souls of the damned stick their grinning
heads through the rungs of a ladder behind
the car, and the devil keeps thrusting his spoonful
of disgusting stew at them.</p>

<p>Hurrah! Here come the conquerors, heroes of
the day! On a throne built of hams, under a
canopy of smoked tongues, comes the queen of
the Meat-Balls, crowned with saveloys, while her
pudding fingers play coquettishly with the sausages
around her neck. She is escorted by her aids, black
and white puddings, and little Clamecy balls. They
make a fine appearance, as their Colonel Riflandouille
leads them to victory, armed with fat and
greasy spits and larding needles. I like best of all
those dignified old fellows with bellies like a great
soup-pot, or with a body made of bread crust,
bearing gifts like the Magi: a pig’s head, a bottle
of black wine, or mustard from Dijon. Now to the
sound of brass cymbals, skimmers, and dishpans,
comes the King of Dupes, mounted on a donkey,
and greeted with shouts of laughter. It is our
friend, Vincent Pluviaut, who has been elected.
Riding backwards, a turban on his head, a goblet
in his hand, he is listening to his body-guard of
horned imps, who prance along with pitchforks or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
rods on their shoulders, shouting out in good plain
French the tale of his glory. He is too wise to
betray his pride and tosses off a bumper with a
careless air, but when they pass a house as distinguished
as his own, he cries, “Here’s your good
health, Brother!” as he raises his glass.</p>

<p>The procession ends with lovely Spring; a young
girl, fresh and smiling, with smooth brow and fair
curling locks crowned with yellow primroses, and
wearing across her slender breast a chain of green
catkins plucked from the young nut trees. The
pouch by her side and the basket in her hands are
brimming with good things. Her delicate eyebrows
arch over her wide blue eyes; her sharp
little teeth show as she opens her mouth like a
round “O” to sing in her treble pipe about the
swallow who will soon be here again. Four white
oxen draw her chariot, and by her side are plump
maids, well-developed, rounded and graceful, and
little girls at the awkward age, sticking out like
young trees in all directions. Something is lacking
to each one; they are no beauties as yet, but
toothsome morsels for the wolf in future none the
less. Some carry migratory birds in cages, and
some dip their hands in the basket of Spring and
shower treasures on the crowd; cakes, sweetmeats
and surprises, out of which fall hats and vests,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
mottoes telling your fortune, lovers’ couplets, horns
of plenty, or of ill-luck.</p>

<p>When they come to the market-place, near the
tower, the maids jump from the car and dance with
the clerks and students, while Shrove-Tuesday,
Lent, and King Pluviaut continue their triumphal
progress, pausing every few feet to chaff the people,
or toss off a glass,</p>

<p>After all, too much soaking is bad for one’s tongue
and one’s wit, so I leave friend Vincent and his
escort drawing more corks, and make for the open
fields. The day is really too fine to waste between
walls. My old friend Chamaille, the vicar, has come
up from his village in a little donkey-cart to dine
with the Archdeacon of St. Martin. As he asked
me to go with him for part of the way back, we
climb into the tail of the cart, little Glodie and I, and
off goes the donkey! She is so small that I suggest
we shall take her up on the seat between us.
As the road stretches out long and white, the sun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
looks drowsy, as if he meant to warm his own
chimney corner more than ours. The donkey
drowses also and stops as if to think, so the vicar
shouts indignantly, in his great voice like a bell,
“Madelon!” Donkey jumps, stirs her spindle-shanks,
zigzags from one rut to another, then stops
again to meditate, regardless of our objurgations.
“Beast of ill-omen, if you had not the sign of the
Cross on your back, I would break this stick on
you,” roars the vicar, all the time basting her flanks
with his cane.</p>

<p>We stopped to rest ourselves at the inn, just
where the road turns to go down to the white hamlet
of Armes which lies looking at its fair reflection
in the water. Near by in the field we see
some girls dancing round an old nut tree whose
great withered branches stretch toward the pale
sky. They have been carrying Shrove-Tuesday
pancakes to the magpies. “Come and dance too!”
they cry.</p>

<p>“Look, Glodie, look at the magpie ’way up
there; look at her white breast over the edge of
the nest! She is peeping out to see what she can
see, and she has made her little house open all
around so that nothing can escape her sharp eye
and her chattering tongue. The wind blows
through it, so that she is wet and cold, but as long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
as she sees all that goes on, she is satisfied. Now
she is out of humor and seems to say, ‘Rude people,
be off with your presents. Do you think if I
wanted your cakes I could not pick them up in
your very houses? There is no fun in eating things
that are given to you; stolen dainties are the only
ones I relish.’”</p>

<p>“Grandad, why do they give her pancakes all
tied up with ribbons? Why do they bring good-wishes
to that old pilferer?”</p>

<p>“Because, darling, in this world it is better to be
on good terms with evildoers.”</p>

<p>“What’s that, Colas Breugnon? What idea are
you putting in the child’s head?” growled the vicar.</p>

<p>“I am not holding it up for her admiration. I
only tell her that is what every one does, you yourself,
vicar, among the first. Don’t stare at me like
that, you know when you have a parishioner who
knows everything, sees everything, pokes her nose
into everything, and is as full of spite as a nut is
full of meat you would stuff her mouth with cakes,
if that would keep her quiet.”</p>

<p>“Lord, if that were enough,” sighed the vicar.
“I am really not fair to old magpie, she is better
than some women, and her tongue is sometimes of
use!”</p>

<p>“What is it good for, Grandfather?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>“She screams when the wolf is near.”</p>

<p>And at these words, all of a sudden the bird
begins to cry, swear, and blaspheme. She flaps
her wings, flies, and pours out abuse toward I
don’t know who or what down in the valley near
Armes. At the edge of the wood her feathered
companions, Charlot the jay, and the crow Colas,
answer sharply in the same irritated key. The villagers
laugh and cry, “Wolf!” No one believes
it, but still they think they will go and look (it is
good to trust, but better to know), and what do
you think they see? A band of armed men coming
up the hill at a trot. We know them only too well;
they are those rascals, the soldiers of Vézelay, who
knowing our town is off its guard, think they will
catch the bird on its nest. (Not this old magpie,
however.)</p>

<p>We did not stop to look at them, as you may well
believe! Every man for himself, was the cry, and
we all tumbled over each other. We took to our
heels by the road, across the fields; some on all
fours, and some sliding on the hinder side of their
anatomy. We three jumped into the donkey-cart;
and, as if she understood it all, off went Madelon
like an arrow from the bow. The vicar forgot in
his excitement the consideration due to a donkey
which has a cross marked on its back, and belabored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
her with all his might. We rushed along
through a crowd of people screaming like blackbirds,
and entered Clamecy first by a head, covered
with dust and glory, but with the rest of the fugitives
hard on our heels. Madelon scarcely touched
the ground as we flew through Béyant at full gallop,
the cart bouncing, the vicar beating, and shouting
at the top of his lungs, “The enemy is upon
us!”</p>

<p>People laughed at first as they saw us flying
past them, but it did not take them long to catch
the idea, and the town was soon like an ant-heap
when you thrust a stick into it. Every one got to
work, running in and out. Men armed themselves;
women packed up their goods, piling things into
baskets and wheelbarrows; and all the folks in the
suburbs, abandoning their homes, fled to the shelter
of the town walls. The masquers rushed to the
ramparts, still wearing their costumes, masks,
horns, claws, and paunches; some as Gargantua,
some as Beelzebub, armed with gaffs and harpoons;
and so when the advance guard of Vézelay
reached the walls, the drawbridges were raised, and
only some poor devils remained on the other side of
the moat, who having nothing to lose made no
effort to save it, and poor old King Pluviaut, deserted
by his escort, full as a tick, like the Patriarch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
Noah, sat snoring on his beast, holding on by
the tail.</p>

<p>Here is where you can see the advantage of
having Frenchmen for your enemies. Germans,
Swiss, or English, do their thinking through their
fists, and are so thickheaded that it takes them
till Christmas to understand what was told them on
All Saints’ Day. I would not have given a button
for poor Pluviaut’s chance with such people as
these. They would have thought we were playing
a joke on them, but no words are necessary between
us. If we come from Lorraine, Touraine, Champagne,
or Bretagne, geese from Beauce, asses from
Beaune, or rabbits from Vézelay, a good joke hits
us all in the right spot, no matter how much we
may pound and beat each other. When they
caught sight of our old Silenus, their whole camp
burst out laughing. They laughed all over their
faces, with their throats, with all their hearts, and
even their stomachs, and by St. Rigobert! to see
the way they laughed set us off too, all along our
line. Like Ajax, and Hector the Trojan, we hurled
gay defiance at each other across the moat. Our
remarks, however, had much more snap than theirs.
If I were not so busy, I would write them down,
but if you can put up with it, I mean to include
them in a collection I have been making for the last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
dozen years of the best jokes, quips, and witticisms
that I have heard, said, or read, in the course of
my pilgrimage through this vale of tears. I would
not lose it for a kingdom. It makes me crack my
old sides only to think of it. There now! I have
made a great blot on my paper.</p>

<p>When the noise had subsided, it was time to
fight; (nothing is so restful when one has been
talked to death), but neither side was keen for it.
Their surprise had failed, and we were well protected.
They did not care much about scrambling
up our walls (you may break your bones at that
game) but something had to be done at any cost;
it did not matter much what, so a little powder
was burned, some petards let off at random, from
which the sparrows were the only sufferers. We
sat with our backs to the wall inside the parapet,
waiting while their plums flew over our heads for
the right moment to discharge our own without
taking aim, (there is no sense in exposing one’s
self too much).</p>

<p>When we heard their prisoners squalling we ventured
to look out. They had caught a dozen men
and women from Béyant and were beating them
as they stood in a row, with their faces turned to
the wall. The poor devils were not much hurt, but
they screamed like curlews. Being safe enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
ourselves, we slipped down along the ramparts and
brandished pikes over the walls, on which we had
stuck hams, saveloys, and black-puddings. We
could hear the besiegers uttering yells of hunger
and rage, and how that did put new life into us!
To squeeze out the last drop (for there is never
too much of a good thing), when it grew late we
set out tables in the open air on the slopes, sheltered
by the wall, and loaded them with victuals
and drink. There we had a noisy feast, singing
and drinking to Shrove-Tuesday. The outsiders
nearly went out of their skins with fury, and so that
day went off gaily, and no harm done. There was
only one drawback. When Gueneau de Pousseaux,
that big fool! got too mellow, nothing would do
but he must walk on top of the wall with his glass
in his hand, just to defy them, and they knocked
his head and his glass into splinters with a musket
ball. This did not much bother us, but to make it
even, we wounded one or two of them, for there
can be no festivity, you know, without a little
broken crockery. Chamaille waited till nightfall
before leaving the town to go home. In vain we
all said, “Old friend, you risk your neck. Wait
here till it’s all over; God will take care of your
parishioners.” He answered:</p>

<p>“My place is with my flock. God would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
maimed without me, for I am truly His right arm.
But I will not fail Him, you may swear.”</p>

<p>“I believe you,” said I. “You gave full proof of
it when the Huguenots attacked your church, and
you threw a great lump of plaster at their Captain
Papiphage and knocked him over.”</p>

<p>“That was a surprise for him, miscreant that
he was,” said he. “For me too, really. I mean
no harm and hate to see blood flow; it disgusts
me, but the devil alone knows what gets into a
man when he is among hot-heads. He becomes
a wolf.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” said I, “you lose what little
sense you have when you are in a crowd. A hundred
wise men make a fool, and a hundred sheep a
wolf. But tell me, Vicar, how can you reconcile
two codes—that of the man who lives alone with
his conscience and wants peace for himself and all
the world, and that of men in the mass, who make
a virtue out of war and wickedness. Which of
these is of God?”</p>

<p>“That is a very silly question! Both. Everything
comes from God.”</p>

<p>“Well, then He doesn’t know His own mind.
Or rather I believe He cannot do as He likes. It
is easy enough to manage one man,—there is no
difficulty about that, but when He has a crowd to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
deal with, that is another pair of shoes. What
can one do against many? So man falls back on
his Mother Earth, who whispers to him of fleshly
things. In the old legend, if you remember, there
are times when men become wolves, and then get
into their old skins again. Ah! my friend, there is
more truth in many an old song than in your Mass-book.
Every man in the country wears his wolf
skin; States, Kings, and Ministers may dress themselves
up with shepherd’s crooks as much as they
please, and claim descent, like the hypocrites they
are, from your Good Shepherd; they are really all
lynxes, bulls, jaws, and bellies, always crying for
food, and for the best of reasons; they must satisfy
the hunger of the earth.”</p>

<p>“You are a raving heathen,” said Chamaille.
“God sends the wolves like the rest, and He does
all things well. Did you never hear that the
Blessed Virgin had a little garden where cabbages
grew, and Jesus, they say, made the wolf to keep
off the goats and the kids? No doubt He was right,
and we can only bow to His will. Why should we
complain of the strong? It would be a thousand
times worse if the weak were raised to power, so in
conclusion all are for the best, sheep and wolves
alike. The sheep need the wolves to protect them,
and the wolves need the sheep, still more, for we all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
must eat. So now, Colas, off I go to my cabbages.”
He confided Madelon tenderly to my care, tucked
up his gown, grasped his cudgel, and made off;
though the night was dark and moonless.</p>

<p>We were not quite so merry for the next few
days. We had foolishly stuffed ourselves the first
evening, just to show off and from stupid greediness,
so there was but little left of our provisions.
We had to draw in our belts, which was soon done,
but we still had some swagger in us. When the
puddings were all gone, we made some stuffed with
bran and tarred strings which we stuck on a pike
and dangled before the enemy. The rogues soon
saw through it, though, for a ball caught one of our
puddings fair in the middle, and who had the laugh
on his side then? Not we, I vow, and to cap the
climax when these robbers saw that we were fishing
over the top of our wall, they stretched nets
from the locks up and down the river to catch the
fry. Our Archbishop reprimanded them for bad
Christians who would not let us keep Lent, but in
vain, so we had to fall back on our own fat.</p>

<p>We might of course have implored the Duke of
Nevers to come and help us, but to tell the truth
we were not anxious to have his troops quartered
on us again. It cost less to have the enemy outside
the walls than the friend within, so the best way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
was to keep quiet as long as we could get along
without them, and the enemy on his side was prudent
enough not to send for them. “Two is company,
three is none,” so we began negotiations, but
without undue haste. Both camps led an exemplary
life. Early to bed and late to rise, playing
bowls all day and drinking. We yawned more
from boredom than hunger, and we actually slept
so much that we grew fat in spite of our fast. The
grown people moved about as little as possible, but
it was hard to keep the children in order. These
imps were always running, crying, or laughing;
always on the go and putting themselves in danger.
They would climb the walls, stick out their tongues
at the besiegers, and bombard them with stones.
They had batteries of squirts, which they made
from the elder twigs; slings and sticks;—“Here
goes. Hit him in the head!” the little monkeys
would cry. Those they struck vowed to be the
death of them, and they called out to us that the
first child that poked its nose over the top of the
wall should be shot. We promised to be careful,
but the rogues slipped through our fingers in spite
of our scoldings and ear-pullings. Still water runs
deep, so one fine evening, (it makes me tremble
only to think of it!) I heard a squeal, and if you
can believe it, there was that little hypocrite of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
Glodie,—witch that she is! my own treasure!—she
had slipped down the bank into the ditch. Oh,
Lord, I could have whipped her! I was on the wall
at one bound, and there we all stood craning over.
We made a fine target if the enemy had chosen to
shoot at us, but he too was looking at my darling at
the bottom of the ditch. Thanks to the Blessed
Virgin, she had rolled down gently like a little
kitten, and sat there among the flowering grasses,
not in the least frightened, and looking up at the
two rows of heads above her. She was laughing
and making a nosegay. We all laughed too, and
Monseigneur de Ragny, the enemy’s commander,
ordered that no harm be done to the child, and,
good fellow that he was, threw her a bag of sugar-plums.
But you never know what a woman will
do next, and while we were all looking at Glodie,
Martine rushed to save her lamb and she too fell
down the bank, running, slipping, and rolling, her
skirts turned up over her head. What a spectacle
for the enemy! Immense applause! But nothing
daunted, she hugged and slapped her baby. One
of the soldiers, carried away by her charms, disobeyed
his commanding officer, jumped into the
ditch and ran towards her. She stood fast while we
threw a broom down to her from the ramparts,
seized it bravely, and marched on the enemy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
Whick, whack! The gallant kept his distance, and
fled from the field without sound of trumpets.
Both camps roared with laughter, and we pulled
Martine up, triumphant, with her child in her arms,
I on the end of the rope as proud as a peacock.</p>

<p>Since talking is always in season, we took another
week for discussion. A rumor was heard
that the Duke of Nevers was coming,—a false
alarm, but it brought us together and a treaty was
drawn up on fairly easy terms. We agreed to pay
to the Vézelayans a tenth of our next vintage, for
it is always best to promise for the future; one may
never get there, and in any case much water runs
under the bridge first and much wine into our
stomachs.</p>

<p>Both sides were satisfied with each other, and
most of all with themselves. Still, it never rains
but it pours, and the very next day after the
treaty, a sign appeared in the heavens. About ten
o’clock it arose and slid across the field of stars
toward St. Peters-on-the-Height, like a long serpent.
It resembled a sword with a flame on the
point, and great tongues of smoke; a hand seemed
to grasp the hilt. You could see the five fingers
ending in dreadful heads; one was a woman with
her hair streaming in the wind, and the width at
the hilt of the sword was a span, at the point six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
or eight rods, and in the middle exactly three rods
and two inches. The color was scarlet and violet,
and inflamed like a wound in the side. We all
stood, our eyes raised to Heaven, our mouths open,
our teeth chattering in our heads. In the two
camps the question was “To which one did the
warning come?” Each of course attributed it to
the other, and every man shivered, except me. I
was not in the least frightened, for having gone to
bed at nine o’clock, I naturally saw nothing. Regularly
as the day comes round, I take medicine and
go to bed early; when the stomach commands I
obey without question. Every one, however, told
me all about the portent, so I write it down, for
it is the same as if I had seen it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>As soon as peace was signed, friends and foes
betook themselves once more to feasting, and as
by this time we had come to the middle of Lent, we
let ourselves go. It was a great day, I can tell
you. Throngs of people came pouring in from the
neighboring villages, bringing their provisions as
well as mouths to eat them with, and tables were
spread the whole length of the ramparts. Three
young pigs were served, roasted whole, stuffed
with spiced boar’s meat and heron’s liver. There
were hams, smoked and perfumed with juniper;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
rabbit and pork pies, simply reeking with garlic and
laurel; our own meat-balls and tripe, pikes and
snails, jugged hare so fat that our noses fed on them
first; calves-head that melted in the mouth; and
heaps of peppery lobsters enough to set your throat
on fire. On top of all, to cool it off, salads with
plenty of vinegar; and then bumpers of the best
vintages from Chapotte, Mandre, and Vaufilloux.
For dessert we had curds and cream to slip gently
down our throats, and biscuits with which we
sopped up a full glass at one mouthful. As long as
a scrap remained not one of us let go, and the Lord
gave us strength to squeeze all these dishes and
drinks into our small bread-baskets. There was
a great contest between two eating champions.
The Vézelayans put up their hermit—Court-Oreille
from St. Martin’s at Vézelay; (he was the
man, we are told, who first discovered that an ass
must have his tail in the air before he can bray);
ours, (hermit, I mean not ass,) was Dom Hennequin,
who declared that he had such a hatred for
cold water that he believed he must have been a
carp or a pike in some former existence and been
forced to swallow too much of it. Well, when the
Vézelayans and Clamecyans left off eating at last,
they loved each other more than they did at first;
since a man’s fine qualities come out strong at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
table, and he who loves good cheer is my
brother. While we were settling our dinner on the
best of good terms, what should turn up but the re-enforcements
sent by our Duke to protect us? We
burst out laughing, and both sides politely requested
them to go home. What could they do?
So they went off rather crestfallen, like dogs
chased by sheep, while we hugged each other and
cried out:</p>

<p>“What fools we were to fight for these people!
Our protectors, forsooth! They would stir up enemies
if we had none, in faith, just for the sake of
defending us. God keep us from our keepers, we
can look out for ourselves. Silly sheep that we are,
we should be safe enough if wolves were all that
threatened us,—but who will save us from the
shepherd?”</p>

<small>THE VICAR OF BRÈVES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="right">Early in April.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as the roads were clear of our unwelcome
visitors, I decided to go at once and see Chamaille
in his village; not that I was really anxious about
him, for he knows how to take good care of himself,
but all the same nothing is so reassuring as
to see with one’s own eyes,—besides my legs
wanted stretching. So off I started without a word
to any one. The river flowed at the foot of the
wooded hills and I followed the river, whistling as
I went. A soft spring rain came pattering down,
now ceasing, now falling again, dropping like beads
from the young leaves, and in the thickets I could
hear the cry of an enamored squirrel. Geese were
feeding in the meadow, the blackbirds sang fit to
crack their throats, and the little thrush trilled
tipu’ti tipu’,—Paillard, the notary at Dornecy, is a
great friend of mine, so I thought I would stop and
see him, for he, Chamaille, and I are as inseparable
as the Graces. I found him in his study making
notes on the weather, his recent dreams, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
political situation; close beside him lay the manual
“De Legibus,” and also the “Prophecies of Nostradamus.”
When a man spends his life shut up
between four walls, his mind is all the more eager
to fly forth into dream spaces and the forests of
memory; and since he cannot rule this terrestrial
ball, he tries to peer into the future of the world.
They say all is known beforehand, and I can well
believe it, but I must confess that I have never
had much luck in predicting the future until after
the event. Dear old Paillard fairly shone with joy
when he saw me, and the house shook with our
peals of laughter. I love the very sight of him. He
is a little man, inclined to stoutness; his broad face
is pockmarked, his nose red, and his little eyes
dance with cunning. He is always growling and
complaining of everything and everybody, but at
bottom good-natured and full of fun, and more of
a joker really than I am myself. He loves to get
off the most awful whoppers with a perfectly
straight face, and at table he is a sight to behold
invoking Comus and Momus, singing a good song,
and emptying his bottle. He was enchanted to see
me, and there we stood like two children hand in
hand. His are large and thick, but adroit, like the
rest of him, and clever as the devil with all
kinds of tools. He is a bookbinder and carpenter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
and declares that everything in his house is the
work of his own hands; not much beauty perhaps
to boast of, but good or bad it is all characteristic
of him. He began as usual by finding fault right
and left, and so to take the opposite side I praised
the world in general, for it is a favorite joke of his
to call me “so much the better,” and I retort by
calling him “so much the worse.” He always has
many complaints to make of his clients, and with
some reason, for they are by no means prompt in
the matter of payment; some of them have owed
him money for thirty-five years and he has taken
no steps to collect his bills, however much it would
be to his interest. Some of his debtors pay when
they happen to think of it, but generally in kind;
a dozen eggs, a pair of chickens;—that is the usual
custom, and it would be thought insulting if he
insisted on his money. I suppose he would do the
same in their place so he submits, growling.</p>

<p>Luckily he has enough to live on, a nice round
sum getting rounder every year, for he is an old
bachelor with few expenses, no extravagances, and
as for the pleasures of the table, nature has spread
her board lavishly in our fields. We have vineyards,
orchards, game, and fish in abundance, so there
are but two ways for Paillard to spend his money:
he buys books, which he likes to show at a distance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
for he is chary of lending, and then there are the
new spectacles from Holland with which he loves
to look at the lady in the moon, sly dog.</p>

<p>He has put up a sort of scaffolding in the roof
of his house among the chimneys and from there he
carefully studies the movements of the heavenly
bodies, and tries to discover the course of our destinies,
little as he understands them. To tell the
truth he does not really believe in all this, but he
likes to persuade himself that he does, and there I
agree with him, for what can be more charming
than to look out at the stars as if from our window,
just as we see fair ladies in the streets,—we imagine
a story about them, some romantic adventure, it
may not be true, but it is at least amusing—— We
had much to say to each other about the portent;
that terrible bloody sword which had been seen in
the heavens during the night of the previous Sunday
and each interpreted it according to his own
idea, insisting most positively that his view was the
right one. After all we found that neither of us
had so much as set eyes on it, for the astrologer unluckily
had chosen that very evening to fall asleep
at his instrument; and thus we were perfectly delighted
to find ourselves companions in misfortune
and foolishness. Having determined not to mention
this incident to Chamaille, we set out across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
country, admiring the young shoots on the bushes,
the pink buds, the birds making their nests, and a
hawk slowly circling above the plain. We had a
great deal of fun as we went along, over an old
joke that we had once played on Chamaille; we
shut a blackbird up in a cage, and worked day and
night to teach him a Huguenot song, and when he
had it well in his head, we turned him loose in the
vicar’s garden. His new accomplishment was soon
picked up by all the other blackbirds in the village,
and they sang so loud as to disturb Chamaille at his
devotions. He swore, crossing himself, that the
devil was loose in his garden, then tried to exorcise
him, and finally took aim with an arquebus from
behind the shutters, and shot the evil spirit; but in
the bottom of his heart he must have had some
doubts, for having killed the devil he then proceeded
to eat him. Our walking and talking
brought us at last to Brèves, which seemed to be
half asleep. We peeped into the houses as we went
by; the sun was streaming in through the open
doors, but we did not see a human being except one
urchin enjoying the fresh air on the edge of a ditch.
We strolled on arm in arm through the narrow
street, encumbered with straw and filth, till, as we
got near the center of the town, we began to hear
a buzzing like the sound of a swarm of angry bees;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
and when we came out on the market-place it was
packed with people gesticulating and shouting at
the top of their lungs. Chamaille was standing at
his garden gate purple with rage, and he too was
screaming and shaking his fist in the faces of his
parishioners. All this was perfectly unintelligible
to us, for we could only catch a word here and
there in the midst of the tumult of voices. “Caterpillars,—locusts,—field-mice,—cum
Spiritu tuo!”
Here Chamaille’s voice struck in. “No! nothing
shall induce me to go!” Retort from the crowd,
“Devil take it, are you our vicar or not? You
know that you are, and it is your duty to work for
us.” “Upstarts!—I am God’s servant, not yours!”
To put an end to the uproar Chamaille banged the
gate in the faces of the foremost, but through the
bars we could see him still threatening his people
with one hand, while by force of habit the other
was raised in the attitude of benediction. We
could catch a glimpse of him through the window,
square of face and round of belly, and as he could
no longer make himself heard above the clamor,
we could see the derisive gesture with which he
replied; but from that moment the house was
closed and turned a blind eye on the street, so the
noise gradually died down, the crowd grew thinner,
and at last we could get near enough to knock at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
the door. It was a long time before we could get
an answer. “Hi, Vicar!” we called, but there was
no reply. “Go to the devil! I am out,” came from
behind the shutters, and we continued to hammer
on the door. “Get out, I tell you! If you don’t let
my door alone you will get a deluge that will
astonish you!”—and the contents of a bucket began
to trickle down our backs. “Chamaille!” we
called out; “make it wine if you want to soak us.”
The tempest instantly subsided; and our friend
stuck his jolly red face out of the window crying,
“Name of a name, boys, is it you? In another minute
you would have caught it finely—why didn’t
you say who you were?” Then he came rushing
downstairs. “Come in! come in! Give us your
hand, and come upstairs and have a drink; you
need it if you are half as hot as I am! It is a real
treat to see a civilized human being after those
dancing apes; did you see the row they were kicking
up? But they can kick as they please, I will
not stir one step. Do you know they actually
wanted me to go out with the Holy Sacrament?
There is a storm coming up too, and the Host and
I would both have been soaked; but the idea of
treating me as if I were a plowboy! I am no
servant of theirs, sacrilegious rascals! I’ll teach
them to treat God’s minister with respect. My<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
business is to cultivate their souls and not their
fields.”</p>

<p>“What in the world is the matter with you?”
said we. “Tell us what has happened.” “Well,
come in first,” said he, “upstairs where we shall be
more comfortable. My throat is as dry as a lime-kiln,
I must have something to drink. Now what
do you say to that? You must have tasted worse
in your time. But would you believe it, my friends,
those brutes actually wanted me to have fasts and
feasts every day, and for what do you think? For
nothing in the world but insects.”—“Insects!” we
shouted. “Well, you really must have a bee in
your bonnet; are you crazy, or are we?” This was
the last straw, and he protested indignantly that it
was bad enough to be troubled by all this folly,
without being called a fool. “Well then, tell us all
about it like a sensible man.”—“You will drive me
to perdition,” said he, wiping the sweat from his
brow, “the good Lord and I have been so harried
and bothered with all this nonsense, I must try to
calm down!—You know these people of mine want
their vicar to provide rain and sunshine for them.
They jeer at the life eternal and don’t keep their
souls any cleaner than their feet, but they expect
me to make the sun and the moon stand still at their
desire.—‘Not too much rain,’ they say, ‘now a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
little warm weather and a gentle breeze—no frost
for pity’s sake—now, Lord, a few drops more on my
vineyard—stop!—now give us a wee bit more sunshine!’—If
you listen to them you would think
prayer was a kind of whip with which to drive their
Maker, as a gardener does his old ass that turns
a water-wheel. The worst of all this is that they
cannot agree among themselves; one wants wet
weather, another dry, so they take refuge with the
saints, for you must know that there are thirty-seven
of them up there, who have charge of rainy
weather. The foremost with his lance in his hand,
is the great St. Médard.—The fair-weather saints
are only two in number, St. Raymond and St. Dié,
and it is their duty to brush away the clouds. Then
there are St. Blaise, the wind calmer, St. Christopher,
St. Valerian, and St. Aurelian who saves us
from the hail, the storm, and the thunder; lastly,
St. Clare who sweeps the cobwebs out of the sky.—The
contradictory prayers of our farmers stir up
discord in heaven, and all these saintly personages
are at daggers drawn with one another, till Sts.
Susan, Helen, and Scholastica actually pull each
other’s hair down. The good Lord himself does
not know where to turn, and if He does not know,
how is it with His poor vicar? After all it is none
of my business; my duty is only to forward petitions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
and the Proprietor can attend to them as He
sees fit. This idolatry positively revolts me, but
I would not object if these good-for-nothings would
not drag me into their quarrels with Heaven, but
they are mad enough to try to make use of me and
the Cross as a talisman against the pests which devour
their crops. They wanted the rats driven
away from the grain in their barns, so there were
prayers, exorcisms, and processions in honor of St.
Nicaise;—all this on a bitter day in December, with
snow up to my neck; I have had lumbago ever
since. Then caterpillars attacked them, and we
had more processions, this time addressed to St.
Gertrude, in a March storm with melting sleet;—a
racking cough for me was the result. Now we
have the locusts, and they want another procession
round the orchards; think of it! with the sun like a
furnace, and black clouds rolling up before a thunderstorm.
I should come back with a rush of blood
to the head, chanting the verse ‘Ibi ceciderunt,
workers of iniquity, atque expulsi sunt!’ but it is
I who would be cast out,—(‘Sacred to the memory
of Baptiste Chamaille, commonly called Dulcis,
vicar of this parish.’)—No! I am in no hurry to
quit this world, and the best of jokes may be carried
too far. It is no business of mine to get rid of
their caterpillars, and as for their locusts, the lazy-bones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
can drive them off with their own hands.
Help yourself and others will help you! It would
be really too comfortable for them to sit down and
let me do all the work. No, I will do my duty to the
Lord, and let them do likewise. They can besiege
me here if they choose. It would not bother me
in the least, and I tell you, my friends, that they
could raise this house from the ground easier than
they could make me move out of this armchair.
So now let’s have another bottle.” Having come
to the end of his breath and his eloquence, he took
a long drink and we followed his example, looking
through our glasses at the world and our future
which appeared rosy enough. Then there was
silence for a few moments.—Each had his own
special way of drinking, Paillard smacked his lips,
looked at his glass inside and out, held it up to the
light, tasted the wine and swallowed it down little
by little, taking it in through his nose and his eyes
as much as by his palate. Chamaille threw the wine
into his big throat at one gulp. “Ha!” he would
say as he felt it going down, rolling up his eyes
to Heaven. As for me, I enjoyed both drink and
drinkers; the more I looked at them the happier I
felt. What can be more delightful than to taste two
pleasures at once? All the same the bottle did not
stand still with me. Not one of the three was behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
the others, but would you believe it? at the end of
the race the old notary was first by a good bumper.
Our souls seemed to dilate under this refreshing
dew, which moistened our throats and brightened
up our wits and our faces. We leaned out of the
open window, touched and charmed at the sight of
the fields in their fresh spring dress, the young
poplar shoots opening under the soft sunshine, the
Yonne down in the valley twisting and turning
through the meadows, like a playful puppy. We
could hear the gay voices of women as they beat
their linen on the stones, and the ducks quacking
among the reeds. By this time Chamaille had quite
recovered his good humor and began to talk as he
leaned out between us. “It’s a pretty good place
to live in after all; we were all three of us born
here, the Lord be praised! Was there ever a
sweeter, dearer country? it fairly smiles at you,
it is so soft, so tender and graceful, fit to bring
tears to your eyes and to make your mouth water.”
We nodded our heads, and he began again.—“Our
Master of course does what is right, we all know
that, but why the devil did He put such disagreeable
people in this heavenly place? I wish with all
my heart that He would send them off somewhere
to live under the Incas or the Great Mogul, anywhere
but here.” “But, Chamaille,” said we, “all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
men are alike, you would not gain by getting rid
of these.” “Well then, they must have come into
this world not that I might save their souls, but to
discipline mine through this earthly Purgatory.
My friends, you must admit that no lot is so hard
as that of a country priest who has to struggle to
knock the truths of our holy religion into the
thick skulls of these stupid peasants; they may take
in the Catechism with their mother’s milk but it
does not stay by them, for such rude natures need
coarse provender. They will fill their mouths with
aves and litanies, often just for the sake of hearing
themselves; they will bray out vespers and complines,
but the sacred words seldom get any farther
than their thirsty jaws; for all the good done to
their hearts and stomachs they might as well have
held their tongues; pagans they were before, and
pagans they remain. We have been striving for
hundreds of years to drive out the gnomes and
fairies from our fields, woods, and streams; but
though we crack our cheeks and lungs in the effort
to blow out these infernal fires, so that we can
make God’s true light to shine in the black darkness
of the world, we cannot prevail over these base
spirits, vulgar superstitions, of the earth earthy.
The people will still find some of this brood of
Satan hidden in the trunks of aged oaks, or under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
rocking stones, though the Lord alone knows how
many we have broken, thrown down, and uprooted;
but to get rid of all the devils which our mother
Gaul holds hidden within her, would be endless.
Every sod and stone in the country would have to
be overturned. The truth is, nature is always slipping
through our fingers; if you clip her wings one
day they grow out the next, and ten gods spring
up for each one that you destroy. Our stupid peasants
think everything is a god or a devil; and they
believe in were-wolves, headless horses, human
snakes, imps, and sorcerers. Just imagine the
figure the gentle Son of Mary and Joseph must cut
among all these monsters out of Noah’s ark!” “If
we could only see ourselves as others see us,” said
Paillard. “No doubt your people are a crazy lot,
but how about you yourself? is there much to
choose between you? and are your saints much better
than demons and fairies? Three Gods in one
was not enough; besides a goddess mother, you fill
your Pantheon and the niches left empty by the old
deities, with all kinds of godlings, male and female;
but as far as I can see these newcomers are no better
than the old: they appear like snails from no
one knows where, deformed, maimed, eaten up
with dirt and vermin.—They make a display of
their sores and ulcers; one carries a trencher on his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
head, another sticks his head itself under his arm,
like a hat. Then there is his saintship who goes
about with his skin in his hand, and worst of all
here in this Church is your own particular St.
Simon Stylites, who stood for forty years on top
of a pillar on one leg, for all the world like a
crane.”</p>

<p>“Hold up there!” cried Chamaille, jumping from
his seat. “Say what you please about the other
saints, they are no affair of mine, but here in St.
Simon’s own house, the least we can do is to be
civil to him.”</p>

<p>“Well, as I am your guest, I will leave your
old crane in peace on his pedestal, but how about
the Abbot of Cortigny who has the Blessed Virgin’s
milk in a bottle, and Count Sermizelles who
took powdered relics and washed them down
with holy water when he happened to need medicine?”</p>

<p>“You might do the same thing under the same
circumstances,” said Chamaille, “for all that you
laugh at it now,—but as for the Abbot of Cortigny,
or any other monk, they would sell angel’s milk
or archangel’s cream, if they thought they could
get our customers away from us: we are like cat
and dog; their very name is an abomination to
me!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>“Come, now, do you believe in these relics, or
do you not?”</p>

<p>“I believe in my own, not in theirs, of course,—I
have here the shoulder-blade of St. Diétrine, a sovereign
cure for the scurvy, and the skull of St.
Etoupe, which drives devils out of the sheep.—Now
what are you jeering at? I tell you I have
documents here, signed parchments, to prove the
truth of what I say; if you do not believe me, I will
go and fetch them.”</p>

<p>“Sit down, old man, I don’t want to see your
documents; now, Chamaille, honor bright, you
have no more faith in these things than I have, I
can see it in your eye. A bone is a bone, no matter
where it comes from, and you are an idolater if
you adore it. Everything has its place in this
world, and corpses should stay in the graveyard; so
for my part I believe in life, in the light of day. I
know that I live and think—very clearly too,—I
know also that two and two make four, and that
the earth is a fixed star hung in infinite space.—I
believe in our local customs, and could recite the
whole list of them to you. Then there are books
where man’s knowledge and experience are distilled
drop by drop! I believe firmly in them. Above all
I trust my own understanding, and like any wise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
and prudent man, I have faith in Holy Writ. Now
are you satisfied?”</p>

<p>At this Chamaille fairly lost his temper. “What!
satisfied?” cried he; “you are a horrible mixture
of Calvinist, heretic, and Bible-pattering Huguenot;
you would push aside even the vicar, and presume
to dictate to your Mother Church. Oh!
generation of vipers!”</p>

<p>It was now Paillard’s turn to be angry, because,
as he said, he could not suffer any one to apply the
term Huguenot to him; he declared he was a loyal
Frenchman and son of the Church, and had a good
head on his shoulders too, so that he could see
through a millstone as well as the next man; that
he knew a fool when he saw him, and Chamaille
was three parts a fool or three fools in one, just
as he pleased; and he added that since God is the
fountain of light and reason, if we would respect
God, we should respect our own reason
also.</p>

<p>After this silence settled down, except for an
occasional grunt as they sat back to back at the
table, finishing their bottle.—I burst out laughing,
and they noticed then for the first time that I had
taken no part in the dispute, though I had followed
the whole argument with delight, and caught
myself imitating the motions of their lips, frowning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
when they frowned, and moving my features
like a rabbit eating a cabbage leaf. Now they
both appealed to me to know on which side I
was.</p>

<p>“I agree with both of you,” said I, “and not
with you alone: let us thresh this thing out together.
Folly leads to laughter, and laughter to
wisdom;—when you want to estimate your possessions
what do you do? You begin naturally by
writing down your column of figures, and then you
add them up. Now why not pursue the same
method with any crotchets you may have in your
head? Add them all together and the sum may be
a truth, though truth is hard to seize, and mocks
at those who would lay hands on her; still there is
more than one answer to the riddle of the world,
my children. We only see one side of the shield,
so I am for all gods, pagan and Christian alike,
and for the god of reason first and foremost.”</p>

<p>This lucid exposition had no better result than
to unite both the others in an onslaught on me,
and what they called my pagan and atheistic
opinions. “Atheist!” cried I, “and why not? my
door is open to all comers; gods and laws of every
degree are welcome. I reverence God, and worship
His saints, and love to gossip and laugh with
such as are good company, but to tell you the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
plain truth, one god is not quite enough for a man
as greedy as I am, so I have saints and saintesses,
fairies and spirits of the earth, air, and water. I
believe in reason, but I believe also in folly, from
which truth sometimes springs. If I have faith in
sorcery, I like also to think of this earth hanging
in the clouds, and I should love to have my fingers
on all the springs that move the world.—What joy
to listen to the bright-eyed planets, and watch the
man in the moon.—‘Silly talk!’ say you, who are
all for rule and order, but let me tell you, these
things are to be had at a price only, and a high
one. To be orderly means not to follow one’s own
will, but that of others; it means to cut down the
tall trees that the highroad may run straight;—convenient
if you will, but ugly as the devil. No,
mine are the old Gallic ideas,—many chiefs and a
strong law, but every man for himself, and all
brothers. Believe as you choose, but leave me to
my belief, and the worship of my reason. Above
all, let the gods alone; they are everywhere, in the
heavens and in the waters under the earth; the
world teems with them, and I not only respect
those I know, but I am willing to accept new ones;
only no one shall take from me one I have already
known, unless he has deceived me.”</p>

<p>Paillard and the vicar looked at me with positive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
compassion, and asked how I expected to get
through the world with my head in such a
tangle.</p>

<p>“There is no difficulty as to that,” I assured
them. “I know just where to put my feet. Do
you think I need to take the highroad from
Clamecy to Vézelay when I can cut through the
woods? I find my way blindfold through little bypaths,
it takes rather longer perhaps, but I pick
up something for my game-bag. In my world
everything is in its place: God in His Heaven, the
saints in their chapels, out of doors the fairies, and
my good brains in my head, so it all works
smoothly; to each his proper task, with no despotic
king to rule over us. It is more like a confederation
of allied cantons, some strong and others weak;
but in case of necessity the little ones band together,
and who will get the upper hand then? Of
course the Lord is mightier than any fairy, but it
is another pair of shoes when a swarm of fairies
make common cause against Him. The biter, you
know, is sometimes bit. You think me crazy I
know, but it sticks in my head that the head God
of all is yet to be seen, for He is above everything;
far, far away like our good King; we know his
stewards and lieutenants only too well, but he is
invisible in his palace,—so the sovereign to whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
we bow is one Concini. Now, Chamaille, don’t look
at me like that, if you like it better, we will say
that the Duke of Nevers is our ruler just now.
Blessings on his head! I admire and respect him,
but when he of the Louvre raises his voice our
Duke is silent, and a good thing too!”</p>

<p>“I wish it were good,” said Paillard, “but as
the proverb says, when the sun is hid, you see the
stars, and since the death of our lamented Henry,
the whole kingdom is under petticoat government,
princes and all; you know who profits by the sport
of nobles; there are plenty to dip their fingers in
the bag of gold, (the price of future triumphs,) that
Sully has laid up there in the Arsenal. How long,
O Lord? before these thieves are brought to justice!”</p>

<p>This was the signal for us to break out and talk
with the utmost imprudence; for we had now hit
on a tune which we could all sing, and we did sing
it with variations on princes, hypocrites, lazy
monks, and fat prelates. It is only fair to Chamaille
to say that his improvisations on this theme
were by far the most brilliant; but the trio continued
in most melodious measure to chant of bitter
and sweet, of those who have too much faith, and
those who have none; fanatics, Huguenots, bigots,
and fools who think that they can put the fear of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
God into a man by a dagger thrust or a blow on
the head. As if we were donkeys to be driven with
a stick along the heavenly way! Damnation should
be free to all who desire it, but let them burn in
a future state without tormenting them here on
earth, and meanwhile leave us in peace, each to
act as seems good in his own eyes. We are told
that Christ died for men; for the infidel, as well as
the Christian, and in truth are we not all poor
creatures, as like as peas in a pod, neither better
nor worse? What place, then, should pride and
cruelty have among us?</p>

<p>Somewhat fatigued by all this conversation, we
then resumed the worship of Bacchus, the only god
respected by all three; even Chamaille declared
that all the monks and sermons in the world could
not turn him from this allegiance, for Bacchus is
everywhere acknowledged as of true French lineage,
and a real Christian. Are there not old pictures
where our Saviour is represented treading
the winepress under His feet? “Let us drink then,
my friends, to our smiling god, whose red blood
warms our hillsides and vineyards, rejoices our
hearts, loosens our tongues, and breathes his right
generous spirit over our France, filling her with the
elixir of life.”</p>

<p>Just here we stopped to take breath, and drink to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
France and common sense; for her motto is always
to avoid extremes, if you would be wise; sometimes,
it is true, one falls between two stools. All
at once we heard a great banging of doors and
heavy steps on the stairs, mingled with portentous
puffings and appeals to all the saints in the calendar,
and Mistress Louisa, the vicar’s housekeeper, made
her appearance, wiping her fat red face with a
corner of her apron. “Oh! Master, you are wanted
at once! Come and help us.”</p>

<p>“Come where, you old fool?” said her master
with pardonable irritation.</p>

<p>“Oh! save us, they will be here in a jiffy!”</p>

<p>“Who? the caterpillars?—let them spread over
the fields. Now I won’t hear another word about
those brutes of farmers.”</p>

<p>“But they are threatening the most dreadful
things!”</p>

<p>“Pooh! what do I care for them? Do they
threaten to bring me before the Tribunal? Let
them come on, I am ready for them.”</p>

<p>“Ah, dear Master! a suit is nothing to what they
threaten to do.”</p>

<p>“For the love of Heaven, woman, speak out!”</p>

<p>“They are all at big Picq’s house down in the
village, and what do you think? They are making
charms and exorcisms to drive all the mice and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
insects from their own fields to your orchard and
cellar!”</p>

<p>Chamaille sprang to his feet. “To think of those
fiends! Sending locusts to eat up my fruit! How
dare they even think of such a thing! St. Simon,
have mercy on your poor vicar!”</p>

<p>We could not help laughing, and tried our best to
calm him, but it was of no use.</p>

<p>“It is all very well!” he cried, “but you would
laugh on the other side of your mouths if you were
in my shoes; I suppose I must go and get my storeroom
ready for these guests! Locusts! How revolting!
And mice! It is enough to drive one
crazy!”</p>

<p>I tried to persuade him that he could easily get
the better of his parishioners and advised him to
try some strong counter exorcism, but nothing
could console him.</p>

<p>“I am lost!” he cried, wringing his hands.
“Picq is terribly clever and sharp; the Lord alone
knows what will come of it. I shall have to give
in. To think how happy and comfortable I was just
a minute ago! Ah! my dear friends, it is all up with
me. Run, Louisa; run, and tell them to stop; say I
am coming as fast as I can. Beasts that they are!
Just let them wait till the next time they are dying
and send for me! Well, the will of the Lord be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
done; it is not the first time I have had to knuckle
down.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going, old man?” we said.</p>

<p>“I am off on a crusade against locusts, of
course!” he cried.</p>

<small>THE IDLER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="right">A Day in Spring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fair</span> April, daughter of spring, the pink and white
apricot blossoms are like your slender breasts, and
your sweet eyes shed soft sunshine over my garden.
Ah! what a lovely day lies before me! And how
good to stretch my old arms and shake off the
stiffness of the night. I have been working hard
for the last two weeks to make up for lost time,
and we three, my two apprentices and I, have
made the shavings fly under our planes, but unfortunately
we rather lack customers; there are few
to buy, and fewer still to pay for what they order;
now purses are lean and empty, but red blood still
runs in our arms, good soil is in our fields, and we
reign over both.</p>

<p>Since early morning the voice of the working
city has risen up to Heaven, “Our Father, give
us our daily bread,” but meanwhile, like sensible
folks, we are kneading it ourselves.... You can
hear the clatter of the millwheel, the wheeze of the
forge bellows, and the hammers beating on the anvil;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
horses stamp and splash through the ford, carts
bump along the road, whips crack, wooden shoes
go pitter-patter; the butcher swings his chopper,
the cobbler sings as he hammers in his nails,—and
above is the blue spring sky, the white clouds flying
before the light fresh breeze, and the genial sun
warming everything. My youth revives, coming
from far on swift wings to build her swallow’s nest
in my old heart once more, where she is more than
ever welcome after her long absence, dearer even
than in those first sweet days.</p>

<p>Just at this moment I hear the harsh grind of
the weather-cock on the roof, or is it my old woman
screaming something or other at me? I turn a deaf
ear, but deuce take the sound, it has scared away
my lovely youth.... She—I mean my wife—comes
down in a rage as usual.</p>

<p>“What in the world are you doing there with
your arms folded, gazing into the clouds, with your
big mouth open as if you expected larks to drop into
it? while here am I working for you like a pack-horse,—you
think that’s what women are made for,
but the good Lord never meant Adam to stand with
his hands in his pockets while his wife slaved about
the house. I say he ought to take his share of all
that is going, good and bad alike; there must be
that much justice in Heaven or I will know the reason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
why! Stop laughing, you great fool! Get to
work if you want to eat. Ah! I thought that would
hit him! Now then begin, and the sooner the
better.”</p>

<p>“Of course I am going,” said I, smiling sweetly.
“It is a sin to stay in the house on a day like this.”
So back I went to the workshop and told my apprentices
to come with me to Rion’s woodyard to
choose a long smooth plank for the work I had in
hand. Cagnat, Robinet, and I went out whistling,
and met my old girl on the threshold still railing
at men and things.</p>

<p>“Don’t go on so about it, Mistress,” said
Cagnat, “we shall be back in no time.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe a word of it,” shrieked my sweet
partner.</p>

<p>Nine was striking on the town clock as we
reached Béyant, no distance at all, but we had the
manners to pause just a second at the bridge and
speak to Fétu, Gadin, and Trinquet, who were sitting
on the parapet watching the water—by way of
beginning their working day. We had a moment’s
chat about nothing in particular, and then went on
our way like steady responsible workmen, straight
on, saying nothing to anybody, because, for one
thing, there was no one on the road; but being persons
of taste, we appreciated the beauties of nature,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
admiring the sky, the fresh spring verdure, a
blooming apple-tree under the walls, the flight of a
swallow, with some talk about the weather and the
direction of the wind. All at once I remembered
that I had not seen my little Glodie the whole
morning, so I told my men to go on ahead, I would
catch up with them at Rion’s.</p>

<p>When I got to Martine’s I found her down on
her knees scrubbing the shop, her tongue going
like a mill-race, talking to her husband, to his apprentice,
to Glodie, to every one else within hearing,
in the highest of spirits, and the floor being
done, she flung the dirty water into the street, and
hit me fair on the legs, where I was standing just
outside the door admiring her,—there is no use
denying it, she is the light of my eyes. Of course
we both laughed louder than ever; she made a real
picture, with her dark hair all tousled over her
bright eyes and thick eyebrows, her lips as red as
ripe plums, and her plump neck and arms, and her
skirts tucked up just as far as need be.</p>

<p>“I hope you got it all, Father Noah?”</p>

<p>“Every drop, but I don’t mind that, as long as I
am not obliged to drink it.”</p>

<p>In I went and kissed my little Glodie, who
was sitting under the counter to be out of the
wet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>“I bet I know what brought you here so early in
the morning,” said Martine.</p>

<p>“You knew the reason before you were born,”
was my answer.</p>

<p>“You mean Mother?”</p>

<p>“Who else?”</p>

<p>“Men are such cowards!”</p>

<p>Florimond heard the last word, just as he was
coming in, and drew himself up, thinking it was
meant for him. “No offense,” said I, “she was
talking to me.”</p>

<p>“If the cap fits put it on!” said my daughter.</p>

<p>Florimond always stands a good deal on his dignity
and hates to be laughed at; besides he is apt
to be suspicious of Martine and me when we get
together, and fancies, sometimes with some reason,
that we are making him the butt of our jokes, so I
said innocently, “You know well enough, Martine,
that Florimond is master in his own house, not like
your poor old father, who always let himself be
put upon; you inherit your docile submissive nature
from me, my child.”</p>

<p>“Get along with you, old humbug,” cried Martine,
who by this time was at her house-cleaning
again, rubbing the windows, the walls, and the
furniture, as if to take the very skin off. She filled
the whole place to overflowing with life and energy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
while in the background stood Florimond as usual,
stiff and particular; he is always chilly, never quite
at his ease with us, our jokes shock him, and he
cannot understand why we often laugh just out of
sheer health and jollity, for he is himself somewhat
undersized, thin, and low-spirited. Nothing is ever
quite to his mind, perhaps because he is always
thinking of himself, so there he stood with a
knitted scarf round his scraggy fowl’s neck, and
kept glancing about uneasily, till at last he
said:</p>

<p>“There is a gale here fit to blow your head off.
Shut a few of those windows.”</p>

<p>“It is as hot as Tophet!” said Martine, scrubbing
harder than ever, but as a matter of fact there
was a good fresh breeze coming in from all directions,
too much for Florimond, who went off like a
thunder-cloud. “He can go back and warm himself
in his oven,” she said, laughing. I could not
help asking her how she got along with her baker,
though I knew perfectly well she would let herself
be cut in pieces before she would admit that
she had ever made a mistake; true enough, she
declared that he suited her down to the ground.
“One should always be content with what one
has,” said she.</p>

<p>“You are right,” said I, “but if I may venture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
to say so, I should think your little man might
sometimes have cause for uneasiness.”</p>

<p>“And why, I should like to know? My worst
enemy would admit that I am a woman of my
word, if he keeps his part of the bargain, but if he
doesn’t, just let him look out for himself, that’s
all I have to say. If he does his duty, I will do
mine!”</p>

<p>“His whole duty?”</p>

<p>“You don’t suppose he would admit that it is
too much for him?”</p>

<p>Martine sat back on her heels, her bright eyes
sparkling with laughter, then jumped up and gave
me a great push.</p>

<p>“You are wasting my whole day for me, there
never was such an old gossip since the world was
made. Get out now, take Glodie with you, she is
forever under my feet, with her fingers in everything
that goes on, (there, she has been in the
bakeshop again, I can see dough on her nose). Get
along with you, do, before I sweep you both out!”</p>

<p>So out we had to go, glad enough to be together,
and on the way at last to Rion’s, but there were
some fishermen by the riverside, and we had to
stop to look at them, give them some advice and
watch the line, and see the float disappear under
the green water with a jerk. Glodie noticed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
worm wriggling on the hook. “Poor thing,” she
said, “he is going to be eaten, and that makes him
unhappy.”</p>

<p>“Well, darling, it is rather nasty to be eaten,
but then think how nice for the fish that swallows
him, and says, ‘that’s good!’”</p>

<p>“How would you like it, Grandad, if any one
swallowed you?”</p>

<p>“I should say, ‘What luck for the man that gets
such a toothsome morsel!’ It is just the way you
look at it, ducky, everything is good if you only see
it in the right light; all is for the best to a true
son of Burgundy.”</p>

<p>It was not quite eleven o’clock when we got to
Rion’s, and there we saw Binet, (who like a careful
lad had brought his rod), fishing for gudgeon,
while Cagnat lay stretched out on the grass looking
on.</p>

<p>I went on to the woodyard, for there is nothing I
love so well as to handle the big logs stripped of
their bark, and breathe in the clean fresh smell of
sawdust; on my honor I believe a fine tree appeals
to me even more than a woman, though I am not
one of those narrow fools who can only enjoy one
thing at a time. If I were in the slave market at
Constantinople, and saw the girl of my heart there
among twenty other beauties, do you think my love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
for her would prevent me from seeing the charms
of the others? No, thank Heaven! my eyes are
windows wide open to beauty of every kind, and
nothing is lost on me. I am besides rather a sharp
old bird,—long experience, you know,—and can detect
the little tricks and dodges of the fair sex under
no matter what disguise; in the same way beneath
the rough skin of my tree-loves I can see life waiting
for me to bring it forth.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Cagnat (who is impatient, like all
young men) has been exchanging pleasantries at
the top of his voice with loungers on the other end
of the bridge, for though the people in the two
suburbs may differ in some ways, they both like
to spend the livelong day sitting on the wall of the
bridge, with occasional trips to the nearest tavern;
and as you may guess, a conversation between Beuvron
and Béyant consists chiefly of abuse. They
call us Burgundy snails and peasants; we retort
with “frogs,” or “pike-eaters,”—I say “we,” because
for the life of me, I never can keep out of
any squabble that’s going on; it seems just ordinary
civility to answer when you are spoken to. In
the midst of our little encounter, all at once the
clock struck twelve! Noon already? There must
be something wrong with the hourglass, still I
ought to be getting home, so I pressed our friends,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
who were looking on, to help us load our planks
on the cart, and give us a hand with it back to
Beuvron. “Cheeky devil,” was their first answer,
but at bottom they were good-natured enough, so
off we went running up the hill to the admiration
of all beholders. When we got to our own bridge
there were Fétu, Gadin, and Trinquet, just where
we left them three hours ago, still watching the
water. They jeered at us for working so hard,
we called them good-for-nothings, and as the issue
seemed in doubt, I sat down on the corner to see
how it would all turn out, when suddenly I heard
a well-known voice, and there was the old lady,
“Will you tell me what you have been doing with
yourself ever since nine this morning? It is my belief
that you would never come home, if I did not
drag you in by the hair of your head, idle, greedy
vagabond! And your dinner is all burnt to a
cinder!”</p>

<p>“You win!” said I, laughing; “there’s not one of
these boys that can stand up to you when it comes
to talking—but I was on my way home truly. I
had only stopped to rest,—go ahead, I’ll be there in
a minute.”</p>

<p>The two apprentices, my wife, and Glodie went
off towards home at a brisk pace, and I followed in
a more leisurely manner—I was going as I was bid,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
when down from the upper town came the sound
of voices, of horns, and the gay chimes from St.
Martin’s tower; and I remembered that the wedding
of Mademoiselle Lucretia Champeaux, and
Monsieur d’Amazy, the Receiver of Taxes, was to
take place today. Every one made a bee-line for
the castle, and rushed off at the top of his speed, I
among the foremost, for shows like that don’t come
our way often. Fétu, Gadin, and Trinquet were
the only ones who stayed behind, as if they were
glued to the wall of the bridge; they said it was
undignified to put themselves out for those upper-towners,
and as a rule I agree with them, and stand
on my dignity as much as any man, but not when
it comes between me and my amusement,—there
is reason in all things! I took the flight of thirty-six
steps up to St. Martin’s at one jump, but all the
same by ill-luck I was not in time to see the wedding
procession, which had already gone into
church; naturally there was nothing left for me to
do but to wait and see it come out, but as the service
seemed interminably long—the clergy love the
sound of their own voices,—I managed to squeeze
my way between the bulging corporations of my
fellow-citizens, till I found myself just inside the
door under a regular human feather-bed. I am the
last man to forget the respect due to the sacred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
edifice otherwise I might have been up to some of
my jokes, but I know what’s what, and can be
solemn as an owl at the right moment. Only sometimes
even owls lose their gravity, and that is what
happened to me, for while I was standing there, a
model of propriety and devotion, the service went
on, and as Monsieur d’Amazy is a great votary of
the chase, hunting-horns were introduced at suitable
moments. If only the pack of hounds had
been there too! I did not dare to laugh, of course,
but I whistled a flourish under my breath, and just
then came the crucial point of the ceremony when
the bride answers “Yes” to the fatal question. At
once the horns burst out with the “set to,” and that
was too much for me; I cried, “Hallali!” and the
whole church roared with laughter, so that the
beadle came to restore order, and I thought it a
good time to make my way out, as quiet as a
mouse.</p>

<p>There were plenty of people outside, many like
myself who are aware that ears were made to hear,
eyes to see, and tongues to tell what takes place—or
what does not,—in the world around us; so it
seemed but a moment before the great doors swung
open again, and the sound of the organ came pouring
out, as the bridal party appeared. First came
the Amazy, leading his beautiful prize, her large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
eyes glancing to right and left like a frightened doe
as she advanced. Lovely creature! I wish she had
fallen to my charge, but to whom much is given,
of him much is demanded, and Amazy has his work
cut out for him. Unfortunately I saw little more,
so that afterwards I could not even describe the
dresses of the bride and bridegroom, for just then
we were distracted by a grave question of precedence
which arose among the dignitaries who
formed part of the procession.</p>

<p>I shall never get over having missed the entrance
into the church, for it seems that the Chief
Magistrate of the Manor, and the Provost, acting
as Mayor, had locked horns in the doorway like
two old rams, and the Mayor being the bigger
man got through first; the great question now was
which of the two would be first coming out, so bets
were freely offered, and meanwhile the head of the
procession went on its way, but the tail delayed its
appearance. We could see, just inside the entrance,
that a furious dispute was in progress between the
rival officials, and as they could not talk loud in
church, there they were, scolding, puckering their
faces into the most portentous frowns and scowls,
and cursing at each other, all in dumb show. It
was enough to make one die of laughing, but we all
ended by taking part with one side or the other;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
the older ones for the Judge, because he was the
Duke’s representative, and you must respect others,
if you would be respected yourself; but the young
men inclined to the side of the Mayor as champion
of our liberties, and personally I backed the better
man. We all shouted to encourage them with cries
of “Go it, Grasset!” “At him again, Pétaud!!”
“Shut his mouth!” But to our great disappointment
the contestants were too much afraid of spoiling
their fine clothes to get to their hands, and the
dispute might have lasted till the crack of doom,—for
there was no danger of their breath giving
out,—if it had not been for the priest, who wanted
to get to the castle in time for dinner,—so he
smoothed them down, telling them it was bad manners
to be late, and worse yet to show their evil
tempers in the house of the Lord, that they could
settle their difficulties another time,—and in short
he got them all in motion. I was not near enough
to hear all this, but I could see that he put his two
big hands behind their heads and brought their
faces gently together for the kiss of peace, and out
they all came at last, marching in two lines, with
the big priest in the middle. When masters fall
out, we are always the gainers, so we were well
pleased to see three at the head of the column, instead
of one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>When they had all gone into the castle where
their well-earned feast awaited them, we remained
outside sniffing the delicious odors of a dinner we
were not to share; but it was a sort of satisfaction
to hear the list of dishes, for there were three of us
there, Tripet, Bauldequin and I, who knew what
was good, so our mouths watered as we heard all
the toothsome things, and we approved or not as
seemed best to us, the final decision being that the
dinner was not so bad on the whole, only we ought
to have been consulted, as persons of experience.
When jugged hare was mentioned, every one had
his own recipe to give,—for by this time we
had a circle of auditors,—and there was lively
disputing to and fro, in which I took part, as
I always maintain that a man who is not
interested in such subjects is nothing but a
fish.</p>

<p>The best housekeepers in the town are Mistresses
Perrine and Jacquette, who are rivals in the art of
dinner-giving; each tries to eclipse the other, and
naturally each has her partisans, for our best jousts
in Clamecy take place at table. No one loves a
good argument better than I do, but I would rather
be doing myself than hear the exploits of others,
and I cannot grow fat by talking of other men’s
dinners. Tripet was of my way of thinking, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
you may guess that I was delighted when he whispered
to me:</p>

<p>“It is ill talking of good drink to the thirsty, or
of love to a neglected lover; I can’t stand any more
of this sort of thing; it is as if a beast were gnawing
at my vitals; let us find some place where we can
feed him.”</p>

<p>I told him to come along with me, that I knew
where to look for the best remedy for his complaint;
of course neither of us thought for a moment
of going home, it was after two o’clock, and
we should have found tempers boiling and soup
cold, so we made for the Dolphin Inn at the corner
of the High Street. It was market day, so the
room was crowded, but we managed to get a table,
and after all nothing is so appetizing as to see one’s
friends around one, unless it be to sit down all
alone to a good meal,—both ways are best.</p>

<p>For some time we had better use for our jaws
than to talk. A delicate little shoulder of lamb with
cabbage fully occupied us; on top of that a pint of
the best, just to clear the mist from our eyes,—you
know the proverb, “To eat dry, blinds the eye.
Food unwined makes a man blind,” but when we
had washed the dust out of our throats we had time
to look about and enjoy ourselves. At the next
table sat a vicar from the country and an old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
woman, a farmer’s wife, full of respect for his Reverence,
bowing and bending her old head and turning
up her eyes as if in the confessional; and he too
had something of the same air, sitting sidewise,
returning bow for bow, but with his mouth full,
radiating forgiveness of sins from a full stomach.</p>

<p>Further on was our notary, Pierre Delavau, who
was treating a brother lawyer to a good solid
meal. The air was thick around them with talk
of interest, money, politics, contracts—Roman republics,
etc., for he likes to dabble in such things
on a holiday, but in everyday life is a conservative
loyal subject of the King.</p>

<p>My eye lighted presently on Perrin Le Queux,
who caught sight of me at the same moment, and
waved his glass towards me with the greatest cordiality,—old
fox, in his stiff starched blouse! I’ll
bet he saw me the moment I came in, but as he
owes me the price of a fine carved oak chest for the
last two years, he was conveniently short of sight.
He jumped up and came over to our table.</p>

<p>“The best of luck!” said he, holding out his bottle,
and when I shook my head he still pressed it
on me. “At least you will have a bite of dinner,”
he said, thinking of course I would refuse, having
already dined, but I took him up at once. “So
much to the good on my bill,” thought I to myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>We began all over again, but this time without
undue haste, as the first rage of hunger was abated
and the crowd thinning out,—there are always people
who leave as soon as they have swallowed their
food,—and there remained only men of ripe age and
wisdom who know what’s what, and reckon a good
dish to be equal to a good deed any day. I sat
where I could feel the sunshine and fresh air
through the open door, where some chickens were
picking at the crumbs, and an old hound lay dozing
on the threshold; outside were the street cries,
“Fine fish!” “Mend your windows!” and the
shrill voices of women. On the other side of the
dusty square were two big white oxen lying down
with their legs folded under them, peacefully chewing
the cud, with their eyes half shut, while from
the sunny roofs came the cooing of pigeons. Really
I could have cooed or purred myself if any one had
stroked my back. We all began to talk from table to
table, in perfect good-fellowship, the country vicar,
the notary, his partner, the innkeeper (Baiselat
by name), and I, and as we were all full, and contented
with our lot, we took a certain pleasure in
discussing the hard times and the political situation.
We all groaned over the bad state of business, the
high cost of living, the poverty and ruin of France,
general decadence of the race, mistakes in administration,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
etc., but we were careful to name no names,
for the ears of the great are as large as their fortunes,
and who knows when an unlucky word may
drop into them? Truth, as we know, is at the bottom
of a well, so we ran but little risk in abusing
those of our masters who were the farthest off,
especially that wretched Concini brought from
Florence under the fat Queen’s petticoats. Each
had something to say against him, and with perfect
justice, for if you catch two curs fighting over a
bone, you beat your own dog, of course, but you
half kill the stranger. However, I took the other
side of the argument, partly for love of fair play,
and partly out of perversity; so I said the dogs
should be treated alike, that any one would suppose,
to hear people talk, that all our evils were imported
from Italy, whereas if the truth were known
plenty of wicked things, and wicked people too,
grow in our own garden. To this they all declared
with one voice that a scamp from over the Alps was
three times worse than one of us, and that three
honest Italians were not equal to a third of a good
Frenchman. I answered that man is pretty much
the same animal wherever you find him, that I
knew a good one when I saw him, and liked him,
even if he came out of Italy, but this raised a perfect
riot, and they all fell on me at once saying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
they knew I talked like that because I was a wanderer
and a gadabout, always stumping along the
highroad. I had to admit that there was some
truth in this, for in my time I did kick about the
world a good deal, when our good lord the old
Duke—father of the present man—sent me to
Mantua to study the enamels, potteries, and art
industries which were afterwards transplanted
here. The whole journey from St. Martin’s to
St. Andrew’s in Mantua was made on my two feet,
with a stick in my hand, so you may guess if I
spared shoe-leather! I love to feel the ground
under me, and the world before me where to
choose, but don’t say another word about it, or I
shall be off again, like a true son of those Gauls
who pillaged the world. “I should like to know
what you ever brought back from your travels by
way of booty,” they said. As much as any of my
ancestors; all that I could cram into my head or
my eyes,—empty pockets if you like, but Lord!
what a lot I saw and heard and tasted,—it is a treat
only to think of it. A man cannot know all and
see all, but he can do his best, and I was like a big
sponge in the ocean, or rather like a ripe bunch
of grapes full to bursting of the rich juices of the
earth; you would have a fine vintage if you could
squeeze me, but I mean to keep it for my own particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
drinking; you fellows pretend to look down
on it, so much the better for me. When I first
came home you know I tried to share some of my
good things with you, the treasures I had picked
up in sunny climes, but people here have no curiosity
except about the doings of their neighbors;
the rest of the world seems too far off, there is as
good at home, and they think those who come from
Rome are none the better for their journey. I
never try to force a thing down any man’s throat,
so I kept what I had for myself, and let people
go on in their own way, and I even went along with
them, for that is the path of wisdom; you can’t
make people happy against the grain, but you can
share content with them.</p>

<p>Following this plan I joined in the usual hymn of
praise. What pride, what joy to be a Clamecyan!
and I believe it, by Heavens! so I sat there furtively
drawing Delavau’s nose, and the curate’s
long arms which he flaps about when he speaks,
and we talked about our good town;—a place
where I was born must have merit,—besides, all
human plants flourish here, they are not thorny and
spiteful, even if their tongues are somewhat long
and sharp at the end. No one is the worse for a
little gossip, particularly if you get as good as
you send; at bottom you love your neighbor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
as yourself, and would not hurt a hair of his
head.</p>

<p>We are all proud of our province, which remained
calm in the midst of the excitement everywhere
else; our Provost Ragon would not join the
Guisards, the League, the heretics, the Catholics,
or any of the extremists, persecutors, or rebels;
and it was here that St. Bartholomew came to wash
his bloody hands, where we all stood firm around
our good Duke, like an island of safety against
which the waves of trouble dashed themselves in
vain.—I cannot speak without emotion of Duke
Louis, and our late King,—how we loved them
both!—for we really seemed made for one another,
in spite of faults on both sides; no one is perfect
in this world, of course, but these very faults in
them were endearing, and brought us closer together;
they were so human! We used to laugh
and say, “Nevers is younger than ever,” or “Our
good King is once more a father to his people!”
Those were the good times, and we can truly say
that we had the cream of it then—Delavau knew
Duke Louis as well as I, but the honor of having
seen King Henry is mine alone, and I love to tell
for the hundredth time of how it happened. It
always seems a new story to me and to my friends
too, for they are Frenchmen of the right sort, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
so I told them once more of the gray King mounted
on a gray horse with his gray hat, his gray coat,—his
elbows sticking through the sleeves,—his gray
eyes, the outside all gray, but pure gold within!</p>

<p>Just as I was in the middle of my story the
notary’s clerk ran in to call him to a dying client,
so I was interrupted, for he had to leave at once,
which was all the more annoying as he had a story
of his own on the tip of his tongue. I knew he
had been hatching it for an hour, but I wanted
first to get off my own little tale. I must admit
in all fairness that his was funny when it did come;
he has not his equal for a story with a dash of salt
to it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>We all went out together, cheered from head to
foot. It must have been just about five o’clock or a
bit later, and see how in three short hours I had
raked in two good dinners, and an order from the
notary for an oak press, to say nothing of all the fun
we had had going over old stories:—well, we just
stopped to take a thimble full of cherry brandy and
a biscuit at Rathery’s, the apothecary, and then the
party broke up. Delavau had finished one story
and begun another, so as we wanted to hear the
end of it, we went on with him as far as Mirandole,
and there we left him at last, only stopping to lean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
against the wall for a minute or two, long enough
to say good-by.</p>

<p>It was now rather too late to go home, or perhaps
I should say too early, so I walked down
towards Béyant with a man who was pushing his
barrow loaded with charcoal, trumpeting his wares
as he went. On the way we met a blacksmith coming
up trundling a wheel before him; when it slackened
speed he made a running jump and sent it flying
on ahead, for all the world like those allegories
where you see men pursue Fortune which always
eludes their outstretched hand. This impressed me
as a very good image, and I made a note of it for
future reference. I was in two minds which way
to take towards home, when I saw a funeral issuing
out of the hospital gates. First came two tiny
choir-boys, giggling together as they walked, one
carrying a cross three times as high as himself
clutched against his little fat tummy. Behind came
the body under its pall, borne by four tottering old
men, and then the vicar. I felt it a matter of simple
politeness to go with the poor sleeper to his last
lodging, for misery loves company, and then I
wanted to hear what the widow had to say. As is
the custom, she was walking beside the officiating
priest pouring out her sad tale; how the departed
was taken ill, what remedies were applied, how he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
died, his faults, his virtues, his affection, in short
the story of his life and hers, while the priest’s
chants filled in the pauses. Before we had gone far
our numbers were swelled by many worthy souls
with ears to hear and hearts to feel, so at last we
came to the resting-place where they put down the
bier at the edge of the grave. You know a pauper
cannot take his wooden shirt with him—not that
he sleeps the less sound for that,—so they lifted the
pall and the coffin lid, and let him slide down into
his hole. I threw a handful of earth over him, and
made the sign of the Cross, to keep bad dreams
away, and then went off at peace with all the
world; since morning I had seen and heard everything,
rejoiced with the fortunate, and wept with
the sorrowful. My cup was full, and, the day being
over, I sauntered back along the waterside.</p>

<p>I was making for the junction of the two rivers,
meaning to follow the Beuvron to my own house,
but the lovely evening tempted me on till almost
without knowing it I found myself outside the town
and I kept on by the bewitching little Yonne nearly
to the narrows at La Forêt. The water flowed by
calm and still with scarcely a ripple on its smooth
surface; my sight was drowned in it, as a fish is
held by the hook; the whole sky was entangled by
the river as if in a net, where it seemed to float with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
its rosy clouds caught among the reeds and grasses,
and the golden sun rays trailing in the water.
There was an old cowherd on the bank with his
two skinny cows: I went and sat down beside him,
and as he was rather shaky on his pins, I told him
of a remedy for his rheumatic complaint;—(I am
rather a good doctor when I have time for it),—so
he told me all about himself, his ills and sorrows,
but he seemed jolly enough, and even resented my
thinking him younger than he was. He was
seventy-five years old, and took pride in it, saying
the older you were, the more you could bear. It
seemed quite right to him that we should all have
to suffer, and, on the other hand, he said God’s
favors fall alike on the just and the unjust, so all
is as it should be; rich and poor, gentle and simple
will sleep at last in the same Father’s arms. As
he talked his quavering old voice mingled with the
chirp of crickets, the water pouring over the dam,
the smell of wood and tar blowing towards us from
the harbor, the tranquil flowing river, the fair reflections
all melting into the peaceful evening.</p>

<p>When he had gone I walked back alone with my
hands behind my back, watching the circles in the
water, and was so absorbed that I forgot where I
was till I heard a well-known voice on the other
bank, and saw I was just opposite our house. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
was my wife,—gentle soul!—shaking her fist at me
out of the window! I fixed my eyes on the stream
and made believe not to see her, but she was reflected
upside down as if in a glass; I did not say
a word, but shook all over with inward laughter,
and the more I laughed the angrier she got. It was
too killing to see her bobbing up and down in the
Beuvron head first! At last she lost all patience; I
heard doors and windows banging behind her, and
she came rushing out after me like a whirlwind.
She had to cross a bridge to get at me, and the
question was which? Right or left, for we were
just between the two. She made for the little foot-bridge
to the right, and I naturally took the other,
where I found Gadin planted on the very same spot
where I had left him in the morning.</p>

<p>Night was falling as I came to my own door.
Though I am not like that lazy Roman who was
always complaining that he had lost a day, still I
do not know where time goes, though none of this
day has been lost, and I am content enough, but
if only there were forty-eight hours instead of
twenty-four! I do not feel that I always get my
money’s worth, for my glass is no sooner filled than
it is empty; there must be a crack in it. I sometimes
think I envy people who sip and sip without
ever coming to the bottom. It cannot be that their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
glass is longer than mine, that would be too much
to bear. “Hi there! you landlord of the Sun, fill
up my mug to the brim when you are pouring out
the daylight!” But I have nothing really to complain
of, for the Lord has blessed me with an appetite
that nothing can ever satisfy, so I love both
day and night and cannot get enough of either.</p>

<p>Swift flying day of April, are you gone indeed?
But it is good to feel that I have not lost a moment
of your sweet presence. I have kissed and held
you close in my arms;—so now welcome, dear
night, it is your turn to share my couch, but good
Lord! I forgot, there will be three of us, for the
old woman is just coming up to look for me.</p>

<small>BELETTE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="right">May.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Three</span> months ago I got an order from the château
of Asnois for a dresser and a chest, but I would not
begin to work on them until I was able to see the
room and the place where they were to stand; for
according to my idea, furniture is like wall fruit. A
good apple comes from a good tree; and there is
no use in telling me that a beautiful thing is beautiful
no matter where it is, like a wayside Venus,
who sells herself to the highest bidder. True art is
an expression of our inmost selves; it is the spirit of
home and of the fireside, our domestic deity; and
to know him you must know the house where he
dwells. He is so made for man, and his work
meant to fulfil and complete man’s existence, that
nothing can be really beautiful unless it is in its
proper setting.</p>

<p>I set off early, then, to see where my chest was to
stand, and what with the walk and my dinner, it
took up nearly half a day; but man must eat to
live, and everything was so much to my mind, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
I was in the best of spirits when I at last started
back towards home. The path to Clamecy ran
straight enough, but when I came to the crossroads,
I could not help glancing down a by-way,
which went wandering across the meadows, between
the blossoming hedges.</p>

<p>Said I to myself, “How nice it would be to leave
the stupid highroad, and follow that little path;
the day is yet young, and anyhow it would never do
to get home ahead of the sun, and early or late the
wife will have something to say to me.... I really
must go a step or two farther, and have a look at
that dear little pear tree; surely those are not snowflakes?
no, of course not, they are the white petals
blown off by the wind. Listen to the birds! and the
tinkling of the brook, sliding along under the grass,
like a kitten chasing a ball.... I have a great
mind to follow it, and see if the roots of this oak
will not stop it; where can it have gone? well, upon
my word! it has squeezed its way under the big
gouty knees of yonder elm,—did you ever see such
impudence? I might as well go and find out where
this path does lead.”</p>

<p>It was all very well to saunter along thus at the
heels of my vagrant shadow, but in the back of my
head I knew perfectly well where that beguiling
footway would take me. Like Ulysses, I tried to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
play the hypocrite with myself, but the truth is,
that I made up my mind where I meant to go
from the moment I left the gates of Asnois. An
old flame of mine lived at a mill down in these
parts, and I had a fancy to go and surprise her,—or
perhaps surprise myself, who knows? It was
many a long day since I had set eyes on Céline, or
“Belette” as they called her, and the chances were
that her saucy face would be changed out of knowledge.
Ah! Belette, I am not afraid of you now!
Those little teeth of yours can no longer hurt this
poor old dried-up heart! Perhaps the teeth are
gone too? I can see them now, and hear your
charming laughter! What a fool she did make of
you, Breugnon; you were a mere toy in those hands
of hers; but, after all, why not? if she could get
some fun out of such a country blockhead as I
was then. I learned the noble art of wood-carving
from Master Médard Lagneau, and I can see myself
now leaning over the wall of his place, gazing
with my mouth open. The wall ran between the
yard where we worked and a big kitchen garden,
planted with lettuce, strawberries, pink radishes,
cucumbers, and melons; and there, at all hours of
the day, I could see a tall active slip of a girl,
balancing two great watering pots in her strong
brown hands, as she carefully sprinkled the thirsty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
borders. She wore a coarse chemise of unbleached
linen, which showed her bare arms and long throat;
her feet too were bare, and her short skirt was
tucked up to her knees, which were round and
strong like a boy’s. The first thing you noticed
about her was the heavy mass of her twisted reddish
hair. I literally could not take my eyes off
her as she came and went emptying her watering
pots, going back to fill them at the well, carrying
them steadily and carefully along the narrow paths,
where her long bare toes felt their own way
cleverly in the damp earth between the strawberry
plants. She did not seem to know that I was
there, keeping steadily on with her work; but when
she came close, all at once she turned her head and
shot a look at me. Ouch!—I can still feel the hook
in my gills, and the net around me. “A woman’s
eye catches the fly,” as the proverb has it. I struggled
of course, but what was the use? There was
the silly fly on the wall, with his wings stuck together.</p>

<p>She paid no more attention to me, and squatted
down on her heels to plant her cabbage, but from
time to time she stole a look to make sure that her
prey was still there. There was no use in my saying
to myself, “She is trying to make a fool of you,
my lad!” I could see her snickering, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
made me grin too:—what an ass I must have
looked! At last up she jumped, ran across the
garden, came back, stuck her feet wide apart over
the edge of the border, caught at a floating spray
of bloom, and said, waving her arm at me, “Another
good fellow gone!” As she spoke she thrust
her flower in the front of her dress. “That’s where
I should like to be,” said I, for though I may have
been a fool at that age, I was no laggard in an
affair of this kind.</p>

<p>She put her arms akimbo and burst out laughing.
“Not for the likes of you,” cried she. “Greedy!”...
That was the beginning of my acquaintance
with the pretty gardener Belette, on a warm August
evening.</p>

<p>The nickname of “Weasel” suited her long
body, with the small head and pointed nose, and
wide prominent mouth; just the mouth to crack
nuts and hearts, and made too for laughter. Oh,
her eyes! dark blue like thunder-clouds, and her
wildcat smiling lips!—What chance had the poor
prey, once in her toils?</p>

<p>I did very little work after this, but spent most
of my time gawking over the wall, till Master
Lagneau would come behind, and dislodge me with
a vigorous kick. Belette got tired of me sometimes,
and would tell me to stop staring at her and get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
out; but I often told her, with a wink, that you cannot
know either a woman or a melon just by looking.
How much I should have liked to try a slice
of her! But perhaps another fruit would have
served my turn then equally well; for I was at the
age when a man could fall in love with the eleven
thousand virgins. Did I love Belette really?—there
are times when a boy like me will love anybody;—but
no, Breugnon, that is all humbug, and you
know it; your first love is the real article, your fate,
marked out for you by the stars in their courses,
and it is perhaps because I missed my destiny that
my whole life long I have gone unsatisfied.</p>

<p>We understood one another at half a word;
though we did nothing but tease. Both of us
had glib tongues, and I would give her back as
good as she sent, quick as lightning. Sometimes
we nearly died of laughing, and when
she thought that she had got the better of me,
she would throw herself down and roll over
and over on the ground with joy, among her
beets and onions. She would come too and
stand under my wall, and talk to me in the
warm twilight evenings. How well I remember
her once, as she stood there laughing, her bright
eyes looking into mine,—she could see my heart
at the bottom of them,—and I can see her now, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
she reached up and pulled down a branch of the
cherry tree, the ripe fruit resting like jewels on
her hair, and then she did not pick the cherries,
she just bit off the flesh of them, leaving the stones
on the stem. Ah! eternal eager youth, with your
lips at the fountain!—When I have been carving
on a panel, how many a time since have I drawn
the lines of her beautiful arms, her breast, her
throat with the head thrown back, her full rich
mouth!... I bent over the wall, and drew the
branch towards me, putting the moist stones to
my lips, where I could still feel the touch of
hers.</p>

<p>On Sundays we walked over to Beaugy, and there
we used to dance; though I was a perfect stick at
it in spite of what they say, that love lends wings,
and would give grace to the very bean-poles. She
was always at me, and never for a moment did we
cease our sparring; she liked to laugh at my long
crooked nose, my big mouth like an oven, my
scrubby beard, and all the rest of it. They say we
are made in the likeness of God, but I hope not, for
His sake.... Belette at least never stopped laughing
at my queer looks, and I did my best to get
even.</p>

<p>This kind of thing went on till we both of us
took fire. I shall never forget the vintage that year;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
Belette and I worked side by side, bent double
among the poles, our heads nearly touching, and
sometimes as I stripped the vines my hand would
brush against her, and then she would rear up like
a young colt and give me a smart slap, or squeeze
a bunch of grapes in my face. Naturally I retorted
with another, till the red juice ran down over
her sunburned bosom. You never saw such a little
devil as she was, but I could not catch her off her
guard. We always kept a wary eye on each other,
for she knew well enough what I was after; but she
always seemed to be saying, “Don’t you wish you
may get it?” On my side, I was just like a cat
with his eyes half shut, watching a mouse and ready
to pounce at the right moment. “Wait till I catch
you, my lady!” I thought.</p>

<p>One afternoon in this very month of May,—our
summers must have been hotter in those days,—the
air was like an oven, a furnace seven times
heated; for hours black threatening clouds had been
coming up, big with the storm which still held off,
so that we melted under the heat, and the very
tools stuck to our fingers. Belette had been singing
in her garden, but after a while I could neither see
nor hear her, till at last I caught sight of her sitting
on a stone under the shed roof, asleep; her lips
parted, her head leaning back against the door-post,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
one arm resting on the big water-can, as if she
were overcome by sudden lassitude. There she
lay, half exposed, defenseless like Danaë, and I her
Jupiter!—I dropped over the wall, crushing the
cabbages and lettuce in my haste, and took her in
my arms, putting my mouth to hers. How sweet
she was! all warm and half asleep! She seemed to
yield, and returned my kisses, but without opening
her blue eyes.—My blood burned in my veins, and
I strained her to my breast with delight; at last,
the ripe fruit had dropped into my longing mouth!—but
in spite of my joy, some strange scruple now
restrained me; I don’t know what queer notions
held me back,—great fool that I was!—but I felt
that I loved her too much,—I could not take advantage
of her so,—half asleep, not knowing what
she did. My proud beauty! I would not have her
unconsenting, and so,—I tore myself away from
my happiness, untwining our linked arms and our
lips, not without trouble, for man is fire, and
woman tow: but I left her trembling, like that
other simpleton you have heard of, who conquered
Antiope. I too conquered, that is, I took to my
heels:—I fairly blush when I think of it, at thirty-five
years’ distance. Foolish boy! yes, but what
would I not give to be capable now of such folly?</p>

<p>From that time Belette treated me as if she were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
possessed of the devil, never twice was she in the
same mind; one day she would launch some insult
at me, or ignore my very existence, and the next
she would meet me with languishing sheep’s eyes,
and cajoling laughter. When my back was turned,
she would hide behind a tree, and hurl lumps of sod
at my neck, or hit me on the nose with a plum;
and worse than all were her goings on with any
man that she could pick up, when we were out on
Sundays. She took it into her head,—chiefly to annoy
me, I do believe,—to flirt with Quiriace Pinon,
a great chum of mine. He and I were like Orestes
and Pylades, you never saw one without the other,
and wherever there was anything going on, a fair,
a fight, or a wedding, there we were in the midst of
it. He was short and thickset, as sturdy as an oak,
a good straightforward worker, and as for friendship!
it would have gone hard with any one who
interfered with me when he was by.</p>

<p>Belette singled him out from all the rest of her
admirers, knowing well enough what it would mean
to me; and she had no trouble at all with him, you
may be sure.—A few smiles and glances out of
those eyes of hers were quite enough to do his
business. What son of Adam can resist the wiles
of these serpents? She would put on her innocent
unconscious air, turn her long neck and glance at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
him under her fringed eyelashes, flash her white
teeth, lick her red lips with her little pointed
tongue, then walk away, her whole supple body
swaying as she moved.</p>

<p>Pinon lost his head completely, and so Belette
soon had the two of us stuck up on the wall, watching
her every step. She drew us both on, so it was
not long before we were ready to fly at each other’s
throats; but when she thought the thing had gone
far enough, she would throw a little cold water on
the pair of us. Much as this last trick angered me,
I could not help laughing at her, clever little cat!
but it drove Pinon half out of his wits;—(a joke
was always a sealed book to him, but he would
roar at one that no one else could make head or
tail of.)—When she was cold to him, he would lose
his temper, stamp and swear at her like a madman,
and she rather liked this rough sort of wooing, so
different from my way with her.</p>

<p>She and I were really of the same Gallic breed—there
was much more affinity between us than there
was between her and Pinon, who was simply a
ramping, stamping sort of a brute; but from pure
caprice, or perhaps to vex me, she showed him the
greatest favor, smiling at him with lips and eyes full
of the sweetest promises; but when it came to keeping
them, and he was ready to burst with pride in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
his conquest, then she would turn and march off,
leaving him in the lurch.</p>

<p>All this was droll enough to me, but Pinon could
not see the joke, and would turn on me like a tiger,
because, forsooth! I was taking his girl away from
him! It came to such a pass, that he actually told
me to take myself out of the way; I replied that the
very same words had been on the tip of my tongue.</p>

<p>“Well then, I shall have to punch your head for
you!”</p>

<p>“It may come to that,” said I, “but I should hate
to do it.”</p>

<p>“Me too,” said he. “Now, Breugnon, one cock
is enough in a farmyard; do you get out of this,
like a sensible fellow.”</p>

<p>“By all means,” said I, “only you are the one to
quit the premises, she was mine before you ever
saw her.”</p>

<p>This made him furious, and he called me a low-down
liar, and swore that Belette was his, and that
I should never touch a hair of her head.</p>

<p>“Do you ever look at yourself in the glass, my
poor friend?” said I. “She is meat for your masters,
in other words for me, so go back where you
came from and dig turnips.”</p>

<p>“Listen to me, Breugnon,” said he. “She loves
me best.”—I shook my head. “Will you leave it to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
her?” he persisted, “and promise to get out if she
takes me?”</p>

<p>“Agreed!” said I, and held out my hand.</p>

<p>It is one thing to tell a girl to choose, but it is
quite another to make her do it; there is much
more fun for her in keeping two suitors on the
string; so she merely laughed in our faces, and
went off, when we told her of our bargain. We
were really fond of one another, but now, there
was nothing else for it, we had to fight. Back we
went to the shop, and pulled our coats off.</p>

<p>“Hold on a second,” said Pinon, and gave me a
great kiss on both cheeks. Then we went at it in
earnest, for when it comes to real fighting, friendship
has to go to the wall, and in five minutes Pinon
had nearly knocked my head off, while I battered at
his stomach, till the blood literally poured off both
of us. How it would have ended, no one knows,
for by this time we were as savage as a couple of
bulldogs; but my Master Lagneau and some of the
neighbors heard the row and rushed in. A hard
time they had to pull us apart, and at last Lagneau
had even to take his horsewhip to us, but they
finally made us let go, and a sight we were to behold
when it was over! At this crisis the third
party made his appearance; he was a miller named
Jean Mifflard, short and red in the face, with little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
eyes like a wild boar’s, and fat puffy cheeks. He
laughed at the pair of us; and told us we were fools
to knock each other about for a little hussy like
that, who was only amusing herself at our expense,
just for the fun of trailing a pack of lovers at her
heels.</p>

<p>“I will tell you what,” said he; “she is only
making game of you; so now, just shake hands and
go off somewhere together, that will turn the laugh
on her, and when she finds that you are gone out
of her reach, she will be forced to choose, one way
or the other, and let the best man win! Now
then! get out with you! and the sooner the better.
You may rely on me while you are gone, to keep
an eye on the lady, and if anything new turns up,
you shall know it. Come on and have a drink, and
forget all about it!”</p>

<p>We did drink, I can tell you,—my word, but we
were thirsty!—and that very night we started off
together for nowhere in particular; proud enough
of ourselves, God knows why! and with hearts full
of gratitude towards our friend the miller, who
laughed when he took leave of us till his little eyes
almost disappeared under his fat eyelids.</p>

<p>The next morning, though we did not like to
admit it, we felt a little less cocky—and we sat
and thought of this precious plan of attacking a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
place by running away from it, and as the sun rose
higher in the heavens, our respect for ourselves
sank lower, till by nightfall we were watching each
other like two cats, though we still kept up a
show of indifference. In the back of our minds was
the notion of stealing off alone to the village, but
neither of us dared to take his eye off the other for
a second. Each tried all sorts of unsuccessful
dodges to get rid of the other man, but finally we
lay down on our straw mattresses, pretending to
fall asleep and snore loudly, though love and fleas
chased rest from our eyelids.</p>

<p>At last Pinon could bear it no longer, and jumped
up, declaring that he was going back. “All right
then,” said I, “I’m with you!”</p>

<p>It took us a whole day to walk home; but we
got there about sunset, and hid in the woods till
dark, as we were not particularly anxious for any
one to see us,—it would have been rather awkward,
and then we wanted to surprise Belette;—we pictured
her in tears, reproaching herself, sighing for
her lost lover;—which one?—but you can guess
what answer each of us gave to that question.</p>

<p>Our hearts beat fast as we stole down to the
end of her garden; the moonlight shone full on
the cottage, and what do you think I saw hanging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
on an apple-tree just outside of her open window?
Not an apple, no, it was a hat belonging to Giffard,
the miller!</p>

<p>There is no need to dwell on what followed,
though of course every one but ourselves would
have thought it killingly funny. I stayed where I
was, but Quiriace made one jump, swung himself
up the tree, ran along the branch, and leaped in at
the window.</p>

<p>In a moment the air was rent with screams,
curses, yells, and vituperations, noise of breaking
furniture, smashed china and glass, groans, blows,
shrieks, and growls, as if a cage full of wild beasts
were fighting. As you may imagine, the row soon
woke up the entire neighborhood; I did not wait
to see the end of it, but made off as fast as I could,
half laughing,—for it was funny when you came to
think of it,—but with the tears running down my
cheeks all the same.</p>

<p>“You are well out of that, Colas my boy,” said
I to myself, but in my heart I was not so sure of it.
I tried to laugh at all the row-de-dow, and mimic
the girl, Quiriace, and the miller. “But oh! Belette,”
cried I, “this will break my heart!”</p>

<p>I didn’t really know if I was glad or sorry, but
on the whole I came near to regretting my escape;
for if I had married her, and she had betrayed me?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
At least she would have been mine, and love is
well worth any price you must pay for it.</p>

<p>For at least a month I was drawn to and fro
between rage and relief; while the whole village
split its sides laughing at me, and sometimes, when
the thought of Belette came over me I could have
dashed my head against the wall. Fortunately such
feelings do not last; we are not meant to die for
love, but to live by it; and then you do not often
find a hero of romance in Burgundy; life is too
sweet to us for that; and since our permission was
not asked before we were born, we feel that we may
as well make the best of it now that we are here.
We need the world, or the world needs us, I was
never quite sure which; but at all events we always
hold on till the last gasp, draining every drop of the
cup, and when it is empty, we can fill it up again
from our bounteous hillsides. No native of Burgundy
is in a hurry to die; but when it comes to
suffering, we can bear it as well as the best.</p>

<p>Well, for as much as six months, I was deucedly
unhappy; but time flows along, and sweeps our
sorrows away with it. Now that it is all over, I can
find consolation, but oh, my Belette! if only I had
not missed you!—and that pig-faced miller, with
his flour bags! to think that all these years she has
belonged to him!—thirty years ago he married her!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
They tell me that he began to neglect her almost
from the first day, (he was just the kind of animal
that bolts his food, and so gets no flavor out of it);
and they say too that he would not have married her
at all, if Pinon had not caught him that night, and
forced him, so to speak, into a wedding ring, which
was too tight for him and her too; for when things
were not to his liking, he naturally took it out of his
wife. So there was an end of one, two and three,
Pinon, Belette, and poor old Breugnon, who has
been trying, ever since, to make a joke of it....
I could scarcely believe my eyes when at a turn in
the path, I saw her house not twenty yards away;
was it possible that I had been walking for hours
among those old memories? There was the red
roof, and the white walls of the cottage, half covered
with the rich foliage of a grapevine, its thick
stem winding upwards like a serpent. The door
stood open; before it in the shade of a walnut tree
was a stone trough running over with clear water.
A woman was stooping over it and my knees gave
way under me when I saw her again after all these
years. My first impulse was to run, but she had
seen me, and as she dipped her pail in the trough
she still kept her eyes on me, and I felt that she
knew who I was, though she was far too proud
to show it. The next moment the bucket slipped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
from her fingers as she straightened herself up,
and then she called out, “Better late than
never!”</p>

<p>“That sounds as if you had been waiting for
me!”</p>

<p>“What an idea! I don’t believe that I have
given you one thought in twenty years.”</p>

<p>“Nor I either,” said I, “but all the same, it does
me good to see you.”</p>

<p>“And me too,” she answered, crossing her wet
arms, and looking at me as I stood there in my
shirt-sleeves. Our eyes met and yet we could not
seem to look each other in the face; between us the
water filled and ran over the rim of the bucket, and
at last she spoke again, “Come in and sit down
a minute.”</p>

<p>“I must be getting on, thank you,” I said, “as
I am rather in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“Slow to come, and quick to go,” said she. “I
don’t see why you came at all, then?”</p>

<p>“I was only taking a stroll about here,” said I
calmly.</p>

<p>“Money and time must be cheap where you
come from.”</p>

<p>“Oh! when I get an idea in my head I never
count the cost.”</p>

<p>“The same old looney still I see!” said she,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
laughing, and “Once a fool, always a fool!” was
my answer. We walked slowly in, and she closed
the yard gate behind us, shutting us in alone,
among the hens which clucked about our feet. She
crossed over and shut,—or maybe opened,—the
big doors of the barn, and spoke a word to the
watch-dog, but I saw that it was to cover her embarrassment,
and that all the men were off in the
fields. I talked as fast as I could, about farming,
chicken raising, pigeons, ducks, pigs, and all the
creatures that ever came out of the ark; but all at
once she stopped me.</p>

<p>“Breugnon!” My breath came short as I
looked at her. “Breugnon,” she said again, and
then, “Kiss me!” My lips were on hers, before
the words were well off them, and though at our
age there is not much to be got out of kissing, it
is always a pleasure, and it fairly brought the
tears to my eyes to feel her soft wrinkled cheeks
against mine.</p>

<p>“Old silly!” said I to myself; “what is there to
cry for?”</p>

<p>“You are as bristly as a hedgehog!” she said,
laughing.</p>

<p>“Excuse me! I would have given myself an
extra shave this morning if I had known the pleasure
that was in store for me, but it is a fact that my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
beard was softer thirty years ago when I would,
and you wouldn’t, you little minx of a shepherdess!”</p>

<p>“Do you ever think now of those old times?”</p>

<p>“No, I have forgotten all about them.” We
laughed, but neither could look at the other.</p>

<p>“You are something like me,” she said. “As
proud as a peacock, as stubborn as a mule, and
what is more, I can see you are the kind that will
never grow old. You were no beauty in your best
days, my friend, and when a man has nothing,
you can’t take it away from him; perhaps your nose
may be rather thicker, and you have plenty of
wrinkles, but on the whole you are not much the
worse for wear. I always say that the main thing is
to keep the hair on one’s head, and yours is not
white yet, and as thick as ever.”</p>

<p>“Numskull keeps the thatch full,” said I.</p>

<p>“You men are so aggravating, you never let anything
bother you, but we poor creatures grow old,
because we have all the weight thrown on our
shoulders; see what a wreck I am! once I was like
a fresh peach to look at, and to touch too, if you
remember? Such hair as I had! such skin, such a
figure, and where has it all gone now? Own up
now, you would not have known me if you had met
me in the street?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>“I would have known you anywhere out of all
the women in the world, with my eyes shut.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so, but if they were open? I have
lost teeth, my cheeks have fallen in, I have red
eyes, and a sharp nose; while as for my throat and
all the rest of it, I am nothing but an old meal
sack, and that’s the truth!”</p>

<p>“In my eyes you are always young.”</p>

<p>“You must be blind, then.”</p>

<p>“No, Belette, my sight at least is as keen as ever.
Do you remember? You were called that because
you were like a little weasel, and here you are, run
to earth, after all your doublings and turnings, and
you still have your little sharp nose, and bright
eyes like your namesake, shining up at me out of
your burrow.”</p>

<p>“It’s safe enough now, at any rate, for the old
fox to come near me. Well, love has not made you
any thinner.”</p>

<p>“Why should it?” said I, laughing. “The creature
has to be fed!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it would do as well to give him something
to drink,” said she, so we went into the farmhouse,
and sat down at the table. The Lord
knows what it was that she placed before me!
I was too much taken up with other things to
notice, but all the time I plied a good knife and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
fork as usual, while she sat opposite with her elbows
on the table, and when our eyes met, she gave
me a smile.</p>

<p>“Are you feeling a little better?”</p>

<p>“Stomach empty, heart heavy, belly full, heart
light! that’s what the old song tells us,” said I.
She was silent, but her big clever mouth twitched
at the corners, and I kept on talking of the first
thing that came into my head, while we looked
at one another, and thought of all that had passed
between us.</p>

<p>“Breugnon,” said she, at last, “I can tell you,
now that it does not matter, it was you I was in
love with.”</p>

<p>“I knew it all the time,” said I calmly.</p>

<p>“And if you knew so much, why did you say
nothing about it?”</p>

<p>“Because, of course, you would have been just
perverse enough to contradict me.”</p>

<p>“What difference would that have made, if you
had been sure of the contrary? You kiss people’s
lips, not the words that come out of them!”</p>

<p>“Something more than words used to come out
of your lips, on occasion.—Do you remember that
night we caught you with the miller?”</p>

<p>“It was all your fault,” she said, “or mine, if you
like to say so, but, Colas, you that have so much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
penetration, did you know one thing? I took him
out of pure spite, because you went off that time
with Pinon? I had been angry with you for a
long time, ever since that evening,—I don’t know
if you recollect it,—when you despised me.”</p>

<p>“I? Never in the world!”</p>

<p>“Yes, you, surely you remember one evening
when I fell asleep in the garden, and you came and
picked me up, but dropped me like a hot potato?”</p>

<p>“Belette,” said I earnestly, “let me tell you all
about it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t trouble yourself,” said she, “but how if it
were to do over again?”</p>

<p>“I think that I should do just the same.”</p>

<p>“What a mutton-head it is!” cried she. “But
on my soul! I believe that is the reason why I loved
you,—still I thought I would have some fun with
you, after that; you deserved to suffer a little, and
who could have thought that you would be fool
enough to go away from the hook, instead of swallowing
it?”</p>

<p>“Much obliged!” said I; “but hooks have sharp
points to them.”</p>

<p>She laughed, and looked at me in the old way
under her lashes. “Well, when I heard of your
fight with that other blockhead, whose name I
have forgotten, (I was down by the river washing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
my clothes, when I heard some one say that he was
tearing you to pieces), I dropped the basket and let
everything float away in the water, and ran off just
as I was in my bare feet, trampling on everybody
in my way. I was all out of breath, but I wanted
to call out that I loved you, that I could not bear
to have that great brute bite you to pieces, that I
wanted a whole husband not the remains of one;—but
when I got there the fight was over, and my
fine gentlemen were guzzling in the tavern, on the
best of terms. Then the lamb and the wolf ran
away together, leaving me in such a fury! It
seems ridiculous now when I look at you, but at
that moment I should have liked to tear the skin
off your back; and since I could not get at you to
punish you, I punished myself. In my rage I took
up with the first man who came along;—the miller.
Revenge is sweet, but I swear that it was you that
I thought of all the time when——”</p>

<p>“I know what you mean,” said I.</p>

<p>“Well,” she continued, “I kept thinking that I
hoped Breugnon’s ears would burn when he heard
it, that it served him right, that I wished that he
would come back now; and you did come back,
rather sooner than I intended and,—you know
what happened, so there I was, tied for life to my
donkey, and here we are both of us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>After a pause I said, “I hope at least that you
get on pretty well with him?”</p>

<p>“About as well as he does with me,” she answered,
with a shrug of her shoulders.</p>

<p>I could not help saying, “Your home must be
Paradise.”</p>

<p>“You’ve hit the mark,” said she, laughing.</p>

<p>After that we changed the conversation, and
talked of everything on earth; farms, cattle, and
children, but try as we would, we could not keep
away from the old subject. I thought perhaps that
it would interest her to hear all about me and
mine; but I soon found that she was too much of
a woman not to have known long ago all that I
could tell her; so we went on from one thing to another,
up and down, in and out, just for the sake
of talking. We were both great at puns, and jokes
of that kind; and it would have taken your breath
away to hear the cross fire of wit between us; and
quick!—we fairly snatched the words out of each
other’s mouths, and laughed till the tears ran down
our cheeks.</p>

<p>All at once six strokes sounded from the clock
in the corner. “Six already!” said I; “it is time
that I was going.”</p>

<p>“Plenty of time,” said she.</p>

<p>“I suppose your husband will be here in a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
moments,” said I, “and to tell the truth, I am not
so very anxious to meet him.”</p>

<p>“That’s just the way I feel,” she answered.</p>

<p>I looked out of the kitchen window at the meadows,
all golden now with the rays of the setting
sun which shone between the long grass blades.
Down by the stream two cows were standing in the
water, and a little bird hopped about on the shining
pebbles. A black horse, with a star on his forehead,
and a dapple gray were standing there; the black
with his head resting on the back of the other.
The fresh scent of hay and lilacs blew through the
open door; the room was dark and the least bit
musty; and I could just sniff the good cherry
brandy from the mug before me. “You have a
nice place of it here,” I could not help saying.</p>

<p>“How much nicer if you had been in it all this
time!” she said, putting her hand over mine as it
lay on the table. It made me almost sorry that
I had come, for of course I did not want her to be
unhappy.</p>

<p>“Belette,” said I, “perhaps on the whole things
are better as they are; we get along well enough
like this for an hour or two, but if we had had to
spend our lives together, you know that there
would have been trouble. Surely you must have
heard that I have turned out rather badly: a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
dreamer, a talker, always dawdling about, backbiting
and quarreling, and sticking my nose into
other folk’s business. I am an idler too, and drink
more than is good for me; all this would have made
you unhappy, and then you would have taken up
with some one else; it makes my hair stand on end
only to think of it! So you see all is really for the
best.”</p>

<p>She heard me to the end, and then said seriously:
“Yes, I know you are a perfect good-for-nothing,
(she did not believe a word of it); probably you
would have beaten me, and perhaps I should have
taken a lover, but if that was our destiny, it might
as well have come to us through each other.” I
nodded my head. “You don’t seem to be of my
mind?”</p>

<p>“I am, of course,” said I, “but, you see that kind
of happiness was not for us; so now, Belette, there
is no use in self-reproaches, or regrets either. It
would have been all the same by this time, whatever
we had done; we are at the end of our string
now, you know, and love or no love, it is all past
like a tale that is told.”</p>

<p>“Liar!” said she, and I felt that she spoke the
truth, even as I looked at her.</p>

<p>I kissed her once more, and left her; she leaned
against the door-post looking after me, under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
great spreading branches of the walnut tree, but I
did not turn my head till I got round the corner,
where I was sure that I could not see her; then I
stopped to take breath a minute, and enjoy the
scent of the honeysuckle. Down in the meadows
I could see the white oxen still grazing as I left
the path and took a short cut up the hillside and
through the vines, until I got into the wood, where
I turned aside for a moment. This was not the
shortest way to continue my journey, but, there I
stood for as much as half an hour, leaning against
the trunk of a big oak tree, with my eyes fixed on
vacancy, thinking, thinking. I could see the last
red reflections of the western sky die out on the
fresh vine leaves, which shone as if varnished, and
hear the first faint note of a nightingale singing. I
remembered an evening when my love and I were
climbing side by side, up the steep vineyard, laughing
and talking as we went, vigorous as the young
life around us; but in the midst of our mirth, suddenly
we fell silent, my hand closed on hers and
there we stood motionless. Was it the sound of the
Angelus, the evening breeze sighing about us, or
the soft moonlight? From the shadowy vine
leaves all at once arose the voice of a nightingale
singing to keep himself awake, so that the treacherous
tendrils might not twine about his poor little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
feet, and hold him prisoner, singing his eternal
love-song; and I held Belette’s hand, saying: “The
tendrils are around us, and like them we cling to
each other.”</p>

<p>Then we went back down the hill again, still
hand in hand, till we reached her cottage.</p>

<p>That was the last time that our fingers clung
thus together, but the nightingale’s note still
sounds, the vine puts forth its branches, and love
still twists young hearts in its supple tendrils.
Night came on, as I stood there, gazing up at the
silvered treetops. I could not tear myself away
from that magic shadow which dimmed my homeward
path, and even destroyed the wish to find it.
Three times I tried, but found myself back where
I started, so I gave it up, and took a lodging for
that night at the sign of the Moonbeam. It was
not a very good inn to sleep in: I lay there turning
over the pages of my life, thinking of what I
had done and left undone, and of the dreams from
which I had awakened. In such dark hours what
sadness rises from the depths of our hearts, what
vanished hopes!—How far off seem the bright
visions of early boyhood, and how poor and bare
the reality looks. I thought of all my expectations,
and the small results of my labors; of my
wife, who certainly cannot be called either good-natured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
or good-looking, of my sons who hardly
seem to belong to me, with whom I have nothing
in common:—of the faithlessness and folly of those
around us, of our poor France torn by civil wars and
religious persecutions; of my works of art scattered,
life itself a handful of ashes, soon to be blown
away by the breath of the Destroyer.—I put my
face close up against the oak tree, and lay there
weeping quietly all among the big roots which
cradled me like a father’s arms; and I felt that he
listened, and consoled me, for when, many hours
later, I awoke, I found myself snoring with my nose
in a tuft of moss, with nothing remaining of my
troubles but a sore feeling in my heart, and a slight
cramp in the calf of my leg.</p>

<p>The sun was just rising, and the tree above me
was so full of birds that it dripped with their singing
like a ripe bunch of grapes. The robin, the linnet,
and my special favorite, the thrush, sang as if
to bursting.—I like Master Thrush because he does
not care for any weather, is the first to begin singing,
and the last to stop, and like me, is always in
a good humor.—They had all passed safely through
the dangers of the night, which darkens their little
lives every twenty-four hours, but as soon as the
curtain begins to rise, and the first ray of dawn
puts fresh color into life—Twee-ee, twee, twee,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
twee, tweet! with what sweet cries and transports
of joy they greet the new day. In the glory of
the morning all is forgotten, the dark night, the
cold and the terrors. If only the birds could teach
us the secret of their unalterable faith, through
which they are born afresh with every dawning
day!</p>

<p>All this merry whistling cheered me up wonderfully,
and lying there on my back, I began to
whistle too, the same tune; pretty soon from the
wood where he was hiding came the cry of the
cuckoo. I could lie still no longer, and jumped
gaily to my feet; a hare near by followed my example,
seeming to laugh at me as he passed; (you
know he once split his lip open by too much laughter).
Then at last I started off towards home,
singing at the top of my lungs. All is good, the
sky, the wood. Oh! my friends the world is round,
if you can’t swim, you will be drowned. Throw
open all the windows of your five senses, and let
the great earth in. What is the use of sulking because
everything does not come your way? The
more you sulk, the less you get. I do not suppose
that the Duke, the King, or even God Himself, has
all the desire of his heart; ought I to groan and
struggle, because I cannot exceed the limits set
for me? Should I even be better off if I could get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
outside of them? No, no, I have nothing to complain
of in this world, and I mean to stay here as
long as I possibly can. Suppose that I had never
been born? I really cannot bear to think of a
world without Breugnon, or what is perhaps even
worse, Breugnon without the world! A plague on
all such nonsense! things are well enough as they
are, and you may be sure that I shall hold tight to
all that belongs to me.</p>

<p>When I got back to Clamecy, I was a whole day
behind time, and you may guess what sort of a
welcome I had, and also how little I minded. I
just shut myself up in the garret, and put it all
down on paper, as you see. There was no one
there to listen, so if the fancy took me I could
speak out loud, going over in retrospect all that
happened, both pleasures and pains, and the pleasure
that we get out of pain, for—</p>

<small>BIRDS OF PASSAGE<br>

<small>OR</small><br>

THE SERENADE AT ASNOIS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> heard yesterday morning that Clamecy was to
entertain two distinguished guests, the Demoiselle
de Termes and the Comte de Maillebois; they
were on their way to the Château of Asnois,
where they were to stay for a month or so. The
Town Council, according to usage, voted to send a
delegation to our noble visitors in the name of the
city, in order to offer them our congratulations on
their safe arrival (as if it were a miracle to come
from Paris to Nevers in a warm easy carriage without
upsetting or losing your way!) It being also
the custom to make a little present, the Council
decided to add some cakes with icing, made in
Clamecy, of which we are not a little proud. My
son-in-law, Florimond Ravisé, is our principal pastry
cook, so he proposed to send three dozen, which
was opposed by the Council, who thought two
dozen would be plenty; however, Florimond being
an alderman, his views prevailed, and the cakes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
were baked at the expense of the town. Some
one suggested that noble ears ought to be tickled
at the same time as the palate; so in order that
the exalted strangers should listen to a serenade
while they were enjoying our cakes, and have all
their senses charmed at once, we chose also four
of our best musicians, two violas, two hautboys,
a tambourine, and a flageolet player—myself. In
point of fact I was not invited, but I never miss a
chance to see a new face if I can help it, and I was
particularly anxious to behold these Court birds of
paradise with their shining plumage, and all their
airs and graces; besides, I adore any novelty, wherever
it comes from,—like a true son of Pandora.
If I had my way I would soon take the lid off
all the boxes, or souls, within my reach, black or
white, thick or thin, high or low; I like to poke
my nose into affairs that are none of my business,
to find out secrets of the heart, and generally know
all that goes on; in a word, I am devoured by
curiosity, but as there is no reason, as far as I
can see, why one should not add profit to pleasure,
I took with me two fine carved panels, which the
Seigneur of Asnois had ordered and which were
easily stowed away on one of the carts provided by
the town to carry the delegation, the musical instruments,
and the iced cakes. My little Glodie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
went too, because she was Florimond’s daughter,
and it cost nothing; and another alderman took his
little boy, if I remember rightly. Finally the
apothecary stuck in a lot of sweetmeats, spirits,
and cordials of his own manufacture; also of course
at the expense of the city. Florimond was indignant,
and protested with some reason; he said if
every butcher, baker, and candlestick maker were
to do the same, the town would be ruined; but
there was no use in talking, as the other man was
equally a member of the Council with himself, and
as we all know, great men make laws and the rest
obey them.</p>

<p>Our two carts were soon loaded with the Mayor,
the panels, the presents, the children, four musicians,
and four Councilors. I went on foot, however,
for I am not yet so feeble as to be dragged
about in a cart, like a calf on its way to the butcher.
The weather was not quite to my liking, for the air
was close and sultry, with a sun hot enough to
roast you beating down on our heads, and clouds
of dust and flies about us; we none of us minded,
however, as we were out on a spree; Florimond
was peevish, but then he is always bothering, like
a girl, about his complexion.</p>

<p>Our worthy citizens sat up very stiff and proper
as long as we could see St. Martin’s tower, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
when we got well outside the town, all formality
dropped off, and left us, as you may say, in our
shirt-sleeves. We cracked a few rather doubtful
jokes, for that is the way we generally begin, and
then there was singing; his honor the Mayor leading
off, while I accompanied him on the flageolet,
and the rest joined in the chorus. In the midst of
all the voices and instruments I could hear my
little Glodie’s shrill sweet pipe like a sparrow.</p>

<p>We did not get on very fast, because the nags
would stop on top of every hill to get their breath,
and then when we came to Boychault, our scrivener,
Pierre Delavau, begged us to go out of our
way a little, and we could not very well say no,
for he was the only Alderman who had so far
asked no favors, so we had to stop to let him draw
up a will for one of his clients, which was rather a
long business; but no one really objected except
Florimond, who this time had the apothecary on
his side. All the same Master Delavau drew out
the document at his leisure, and the others had to
put up with it as best they could.</p>

<p>We got to the château at last;—you always do,
in the end, and there were the fine Court birds just
leaving the table, so the dessert we brought came
in at the right moment. Down they sat and began
all over again; you never saw such birds for eating;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
and now we made a brilliant entrance, for our
delegation had halted outside the gates to put on
their carefully folded robes, which they had been
sitting on all the way to keep them from fading.
The Mayor’s was of bright green silk, and the
others woolen of a light yellow, so that they looked
like a cucumber and four pumpkins as we marched
into the courtyard to the sound of our instruments.
Every window in the castle was filled with heads
at our approach, and our courtly guests deigned
to show themselves in the doorway, all curled and
beribboned, as the green and yellow Mayor and
Council mounted the great staircase. We smaller
fry, musicians and others, stayed behind in the
yard, so that I could not hear very clearly the
fine Latin discourse delivered by our notary; which
mattered the less, as I do believe Master Pierre
himself was the only one who did hear it. But
the one thing I would not have missed for a kingdom
was the sight of my darling Glodie stepping
carefully upward with the basket piled high with
cakes clasped tight in her little arms. She was
like pictures of the Presentation. Sweetheart! I
longed to hug her! Music is not the only thing
which charms all heart; childhood has a spell even
stronger and more universal, which causes the
proudest to forget for the moment rank and dignity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
Mademoiselle de Termes could not help smiling
at Glodie, then she took her up on her knees
and kissed her, and finally broke one of the famous
cakes in two, ate half herself, and as she said laughing,
“Open your little beak, birdie,” stuck the other
half into the child’s rosy mouth. “Hurrah for the
Flower of Nevers!” I shouted, and then played a
gay little phrase on my flute, which sounded like
the note of a swallow. This made every one laugh,
and as they all looked to see who was playing Glodie
clapped her hands and said, “That is my Grandad.”
And so Monsieur d’Asnois made a sign to me
to come up, and said to those about him, “You
really ought to see Breugnon, he is just the least
bit cracked.” (I am no more cracked than he is,
but I went up as I was bid, with a fine bow to the
company.)</p>

<p>All the time that I was bowing and scraping to
right and left, I had my eye on the noble lady,
hung like a slender bell-clapper in the midst of her
spreading draperies; and I could not help wondering
how she would look if divested of her voluminous
garments,—(a bold idea for a man like me,
but only an idea, of course, or you will wonder
how I dared to think of such a thing), for she was
tall and thin, rather dark-skinned under a thick
coating of powder; her hair fell in ringlets over her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
great brown eyes shining like carbuncles; she had
full red lips and a small pointed nose like a ferret;
you should have seen the condescending air with
which she said to me, “This charming little girl is
your grandchild, they tell me.”</p>

<p>“Madam,” said I, in my best manner, “I must
refer you to my son-in-law, here present, for an
answer to that question; but you may be sure that
as she is not made of money we do not quarrel over
her,—the poor, you know, find their wealth in their
children.”</p>

<p>She was so kind as to smile at my pleasantry,
and my Lord of Asnois burst out laughing. Florimond
laughed too, but not so heartily, and I remained
as grave as a judge. Then his Lordship
and the lady deigned to enter into conversation
with me about my trade, and what I made by it, for
they took it for granted that I was a minstrel. I
told them I made little or nothing, which was true
enough, but as they had not asked me I did not say
what I did for my living, but let them go on talking
while I laughed in my sleeve at the airs they gave
themselves, the haughty familiarity with which
these fine gentlemen of rank and wealth treat us
poor devils. They speak to a poor man as if he
were a child, or half-witted. God has so ordered
it that only the unworthy are at the bottom of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
ladder,—(that is what they think, if they would
only admit it), and therefore praise be to the Lord!
who has exalted the seats of the mighty!</p>

<p>The Lord of Maillebois spoke to his companion
as if I were not within hearing. “Madame,” said
he, “we may as well fill up our time and have a
little talk with this fellow; he seems rather stupid,
but as he goes about from one tavern to another,
playing on his flageolet, he probably knows what
people hereabouts are thinking.”</p>

<p>“Hush!”</p>

<p>“If indeed they can be said to think at all.”</p>

<p>So they said to me:</p>

<p>“Well, my man, tell us what ideas prevail in the
province?”</p>

<p>“Ideas?” said I, as if I had never heard the word
before, looking slyly at our good Lord of Asnois,
who laughed to himself under his big bushy beard,
but let me go on.</p>

<p>“Ideas do not seem to grow plentifully in this
part of the country,” said Maillebois with his heavy
playfulness, “but I mean I want to know what the
people are thinking,—are they loyal to Church and
King?”</p>

<p>“God is great, and so is His Majesty; we are
devoted to both of them.”</p>

<p>“And how about the Princes?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>“They too are great gentlemen.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that you are on their side?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, my Lord, we are close beside
them.”</p>

<p>“In that case you must be against Concini?”</p>

<p>“By no means, your Lordship, we are for him
also.”</p>

<p>“But, man, you don’t seem to understand that
they are enemies.”</p>

<p>“That may be—but we want both of them to
succeed.”</p>

<p>“How absurd! You have to be on one side or
the other, don’t you know that? Stupid!”</p>

<p>“Must I really, my Lord? Can’t I get out of it?
Well, if I must, I must, only let me think it over;
a man can’t make up his mind like that all in a
minute!”</p>

<p>“Why, what in the world are you waiting for?”</p>

<p>“Only to know which will come out on top!”</p>

<p>“You ought to be ashamed of yourself, you rascal!
Do you mean that you have not sense enough
to know light from darkness, or the King from his
enemies?”</p>

<p>I explained with an air of perfect simplicity that
I was not so blinded but that I could tell day from
night, but that when it came to the King or the
Princes, if I was forced to choose between them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
I could not tell which party drank most, or did the
greatest harm to the country. “Far be it from me,”
said I, “to speak evil of dignities. I wish them
all good health and prosperity. To you too, your
noble Lordship! They have fine appetites and I
am something of a hearty eater myself, but to make
a clean breast of it, if they must eat, I had rather
it should be at some one’s else expense!”</p>

<p>“Do you respect nothing, fellow?”</p>

<p>“I respect and love my own belongings.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know that it is your duty to make
sacrifices for the King, your master?”</p>

<p>I told him respectfully that I should be only too
glad to do so if there was no way of getting out of
it, but I asked him to explain to me how it happened
that there were the people of France, who
loved their fields and their vineyards, and there
also was the King who wanted only to devour
them;—I said I knew well enough that every one
had his place in the world, and some were made to
eat and some to be eaten; politics I had heard was
the art of filling your own stomach, and that was
an art reserved for the noble, and the land for the
peasant. But what was a poor man to do, since he
was not allowed to have an opinion? And besides,
as we are all as ignorant as our father Adam, (they
say that he was his Lordship’s father also, but I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
could not well believe it, maybe he was only a
cousin)—our business is to plow and enrich the soil,
to sow and reap, to plant vines and gather grapes,
make wine and bread, work in wood and stone, in
cloth and leather; lay out canals and highways,
erect great cathedrals and cities adorned with gardens,
and embellish with carving and statues; catch
sound and imprison it in the flanks of a fiddle, make
ourselves masters, in short, of France, the earth and
the air above us;—all to add to the pleasure of our
lords. How could the people be expected to go any
farther and try to grasp the high designs of kings,
the quarrels of princes, with all their politics and
metaphysics? No, the stick is made for beasts of
burden, but which cudgel is the softest and who is
to shake it over our backs, is a question too hard
for us to decide; if we had the stick in our own
hands for a little while it might be easier, but in
the meantime there is nothing for it but patience,
and to bear the blows as long as we are the anvil;
some day our turn will come at the hammer! While
I was talking, the Seigneur of Maillebois stood
looking at me, in two minds whether to laugh or be
angry; fortunately one of his equerries had seen
me one day when I was with the late Duke, and he
explained who I was, that I was no minstrel, but
a fine sculptor and worker in wood, known far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
and wide for my talk, and somewhat of a free
thinker.</p>

<p>The noble Lord did not seem much impressed
by this information, but he showed a faint interest
in my insignificant personality when his host told
him that my work had been admired by princes of
his acquaintance, and he soon fell into ecstasies
when they showed him the fountain I had made in
the courtyard. It is a girl with her skirts tucked
up, holding two ducks in her apron with their
wings extended; the water trickles out of their
beaks;—a pretty conceit as I think it. He saw
also my carved furniture and panels in the castle,
which Asnois displayed with as much pride as if
he had been their creator instead of being merely
the man who paid for them. Maillebois expressed
himself as astonished that I should bury my talent
so far from Paris, and he also wondered that I
should confine myself to work which showed chiefly
observation and fidelity to nature; no grandeur or
symbolism, nothing allegorical, both things which
the critic considers essential to great sculpture.
(A lord, you know, admires nothing that is not
lordly.)</p>

<p>To which I replied with due respect, as became a
country booby, that I knew my place, and was
always careful to keep in it; that it would be presumption<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
for a poor man like me, without knowledge
or education, to attempt anything vast or
sublime, and that he ought to be content with a
modest place on the lowest step of Mount Parnassus,
aiming only at such things as may be useful
in everyday life. Utility in art should be his
motto.</p>

<p>“Utility in art!” exclaimed his Lordship; “that
is a contradiction in terms, true beauty is only
found in what is useless.”</p>

<p>“A lofty sentiment,” said I, bowing, “and profoundly
true; you see it everywhere, in art as well
as in life; a diamond is beautiful, and so is a king,
a prince, a great noble, or a flower.”</p>

<p>On this he turned away, much pleased with so
much proper feeling; but Asnois pinched me, and
whispered in my ear, “Shut up, you old humbug!
I don’t mind if you do make a fool of this fop from
Paris, but don’t try anything of that sort on me, or
it will be the worse for you!”</p>

<p>“Oh! your Lordship, how could you think me
capable of such a thing? As if I would be so ungrateful
to my protector, my benefactor! and not
only ungrateful but foolish. Breugnon is not that
kind of a fool, he knows enough to take good care
of his own skin, and your Lordship is not only
stronger,—that is as it should be,—but ever so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
much cleverer than I am. What chance should I
have against an old fox like the Lord of Asnois,
if I may venture to say so? You who get the better
of young and old, gentle and simple.”</p>

<p>Nothing is so agreeable as to be praised for
talents which we do not possess; so he fairly
beamed as he answered, “Your tongue is long
enough in all conscience, but now I should like to
know what brought you here today? For I’ll be
bound you were after something.”</p>

<p>“There now, what was I saying just this minute?
You see through a man as if he were a pane of
glass; like God Almighty, the heart has no secrets
from your Lordship.” Then of course I unpacked
my two panels, and also something else I had
brought, namely an Italian piece picked up at
Mantua, representing Fortune on her wheel, which,
through a mistake I am at a loss to account for, I
claimed as my own. It did not excite much admiration.
Then I showed a medallion of a girl’s head,
done by me, as the product of an Italian chisel, and
it received a perfect ovation! you never heard such
ohs! and ahs! The Lord of Maillebois was particularly
enthusiastic; he said he could detect in this
admirable work the influence of a land twice blessed
by Heaven,—by Jupiter and by Jesus Christ; and
the Lord of Asnois ended by giving me thirty-six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
ducats for it,—but I only got three for the
Fortune!</p>

<p>As we were coming home that evening I told
my friends a little anecdote which I thought would
amuse them. The Duke of Bellegarde came some
years ago to Clamecy to shoot at the popinjay, but
as he was short-sighted, I was hidden behind the
target, and instructed to throw down the wooden
bird as soon as he fired, and in its place to substitute
as quickly as possible a bird with a hole
through the middle. We all laughed at this story,
and then each in his turn had some such thing to
tell of our noble masters. If they could only hear
some of the jokes we have at their expense, they
would not be quite so bored perhaps in the midst
of their royal grandeur. Nothing was said, you may
be sure, about the medallion till we were safe at
home, and the door shut, and then Florimond was
much vexed with me because I had sold the Italian
piece at such a low price as my own, seeing that
they had been willing to pay anything I asked for
the other; but as I said, I liked to laugh at people
but not to skin them; that naturally made him
crosser than ever, and he wanted to know what fun
I could find in cheating myself? And if there was
any sport in making a mock of people unless there
was something to be gained by it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>“Florimond,” said my daughter Martine gravely,
“we were all like that at home, always jolly and
ready for a good story. You ought not to complain
of that sort of disposition, for it is much to
your advantage, and it is lucky for you that the idea
that I could deceive you at any moment is so amusing
to me that I don’t care to do it. Now don’t
put on that gloomy air; you know the proverb,
‘No need to cry out before you are hurt.’”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VII<br>

<small>THE PLAGUE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have recently had reason to feel the full truth
of the old saying: “Evil comes on a swift horse,
but is slow of foot to leave us.” This time we had
hardly any warning, for on Monday of last week
we heard of the first case of the plague at St.
Fargeau, and the evil seed sprang up so rapidly
that by the end of the week there were ten more
cases and yesterday it broke out here in our neighborhood
at Coulanges-la-Vineuse. You can imagine
what a clatter there was in our duck-pond, and how
the boldest took to their heels! Most of the women
and children were packed off to Montenoison to
be out of danger; leaving an unwonted calm behind
them, at least in my household; it’s an ill wind
that blows no one good!</p>

<p>Florimond went in charge of the female detachment,
on the pretext that he could not leave Martine,
as she was near her confinement, but he was
kept in countenance by many another gentleman,
who, when his carriage was at the door, thought it
was a good time to go and see how the crops were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
getting on at a distance. We who stayed behind
put a good face on it, and had no end of fun out of
the people who were frightened, and their precautions.
The Provost stationed guards at the town
gates, and on the road to Auxerre, with strict orders
to turn back any tramps or beggars who might
attempt to enter, and even the well-to-do, whose
purses at least were perfectly healthy, had to be examined
by our three physicians, Messrs. Etienne
Loyseau, Martin Frotier, and Philibert des Veaux,
all fortified against the plague by means of masks,
spectacles, and long false noses filled with unguents.
Everybody laughed so much at them that Frotier
could bear it no longer, and tore off his nose, declaring
that he for his part had no faith in such
nonsense; all the same, poor old chap, he died of it,
but so did Loyseau also, who kept his nose on, and
shared a bed with him. The only survivor of the
three was des Veaux, who was better advised than
his colleagues, and abandoned his post instead of
his precautions. But I have got ahead of my
story and must go back and begin again at the beginning.
We all whistled loudly to keep our courage
up, declaring that our tanneries would keep off
the pestilence, as it is well known that there is
nothing so healthy as the smell of leather. The last
visitation we had had of the plague was about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
year 1580 (I remember it well, for I was nearly
fourteen years old); she poked her nose then over
our threshold, but came no farther, to the astonishment
of all our neighbors, particularly those of
Châtel-Censoir, who were so disgusted with their
patron, St. Potentian, who had not taken good care
of them, that they turned him out, and tried seven
others in succession, until in despair they fell back
on a female of the same name, St. Potentiana. We
told this, and lots of other old stories, with shouts
of laughter; and to show that we were above such
silly superstitions, and had no faith in the Provost’s
regulations either, we went boldly down to the
Chastelot gate and talked across the moat with all
the vagrants assembled there. Some of us even
slipped out between the angels who stood guard before
our paradise,—(they did not take themselves
seriously either), and shared a bottle with some of
these outcasts in a nearby tavern. Need I say that
I was one of the number? for naturally I could not
bear the thought that the others should go swaggering,
drinking and talking, and I not of the party.
I met a friend out there, a farmer from Mailly-le-Château,
and we had a drink together. He was a
jolly old bird with a round red face fairly shining
with health and good cheer, and he was even more
boastful about the plague than I was, pooh-poohing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
the whole thing and declaring that it was all an invention
of the doctors and that people died of fear,
and not of the pestilence; said he, “I’ll tell you the
best remedy I know for it, and I won’t charge you
anything either!”</p>

<p>We sat there with our heads together for an
hour or more; he had a trick of poking you in the
ribs, or slapping you on the back or the leg, which
I did not notice much at the time, but you may
believe I thought of it afterwards, when the next
morning one of my apprentices told me that old
farmer Grattepain was dead! It made the cold
shivers go down my back, and in my heart I gave
myself up for lost, but I went back to the shop
and fussed about a little, though I was hardly conscious
of what I was about, and kept saying to
myself, “You have done for yourself now, you old
idiot.” Still, in our part of the world we don’t
waste time over what we ought to have done the
day before yesterday, we just take hold and do
what we can at the present moment; so I resolved
to keep the enemy at bay as long as I was able,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
telling myself that I still had a good fighting
chance. The idea of consulting a doctor occurred
to me (going to St. Cosmo’s shop, as we call it),
but in spite of the trouble I was in, I had enough
self-control not to do it, for, as I said to myself,
doctors really know no more than we do, they will
only take my fee, and send me to the pest-house,
and there I shall catch the plague and no mistake;
no, so long as I have my wits about me, I will ask
help of no man; dying is, after all, a lonely business,
and as the saying goes, “In spite of every drug
and leech, we live until Death’s door we reach.”</p>

<p>All this time, in spite of my bravado, I began to
have queer feelings in my stomach, in my head,
and all over my body; I cannot get over it when I
think of the delicious dish of mutton and beans,
dressed with wine sauce, which I actually refused
at dinner time. I could not swallow a mouthful;
thought I, “This is final; if my appetite is gone, I
must be done for.” I had to decide quickly on
what was best to do; as I knew very well that if I
died in my house the Councilors would burn it
down on the pretext that it was infected. Just
think of being mean and stupid enough to burn
a new house for such a reason as that! But sooner
than that should happen I would rather go out and
die on my own dunghill. So, without losing a minute,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
I put on the worst old clothes I could find,
made a bundle of a few books which I tied up with
a chunk of bread and a candle, and told the apprentice
to take a good holiday; then I locked the door
of my house behind me, collected a few of my
best books, and set off for a little place I had outside
the town on the road to Beaumont, where I
had built a little sort of shed or hut where I kept
all sorts of rubbish, garden tools, a straw mattress,
and a broken chair or two, “if they burn that,”
thinks I, “there will be no great harm done!”</p>

<p>I had not been there five minutes before I was in
a high fever, my teeth chattered, I had a sharp
stitch in my side, and my gizzard felt as if it was
upside down. Now don’t think for a moment, my
friends, that at this painful moment I was heroic
and endured my sufferings in the grand manner,
like noble Romans in the history books. As I was
all by myself with nothing near but the stomach-ache,
I just threw myself down on my straw mattress
and howled. You could have heard me as
far as the big tree of Sembert.</p>

<p>“Good Lord,” I groaned, “what pleasure can
You take in tormenting a poor creature who never
did You any harm? Oh, how my head aches! and
my back feels as if it were broken. It is hard to be
cut off in the flower of one’s age and what difference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
can it make <i>when</i> I go to Heaven?—of course
it would be a pleasure—an honor I mean, but why
this indecent haste, since we are sure to meet
sooner or later? I am perfectly willing to wait, for
my part; a poor worm like me! Lord, if it is Your
will, I am, as You see, resigned and humble but—oh,
I can’t bear these pains another minute!”</p>

<p>All this weeping and praying did not seem to do
much good to my body, but it eased my mind a
little, and as I became calmer I reflected that God
was either deaf to my cries, or else that He did not
choose to listen, which is much the same thing
when you come to think of it. If man is made in
His likeness, I thought, He will act as seems good
to Him, so I may as well save my breath, for to all
appearance what I have will not last more than an
hour or two, so I will try and make the most of
what is left in this dear old body, which I am reluctant
to quit, even if it is to better myself. Well,
we can die but once, so I may as well see how the
thing is done, now that there is no help for it.
When I was a little boy, I used to make willow-whistles,
and I found the best way to loosen the
bark was to tap it sharply with a knife-handle.</p>

<p>“Ah-h, I had a hard knock that time! The Lord
no doubt is getting my bark off by the same
method, but it does seem a strange sort of amusement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
for a Personage of His age, and there is nothing
left for me but to watch and see what happens,
which is hard when such a horrible commotion is
going on inside one!”—[Here the author takes the
liberty of omitting some lines, as Breugnon enters,
with somewhat too much detail, into the disordered
state of his machinery, which we fear would not
be of interest to the general reader.]—There I lay
reflecting, and sometimes stopping to howl a little,
and at last I lighted my candle and stuck it in the
neck of an old bottle, which smelt still of the spirit
that once had filled it. “My body and soul will be
like that by this time tomorrow,” thought I, and
then I turned over and tried to read a little, but the
Romans and their lofty sentiments rather bored
me, especially their self-satisfaction. “We are not
all worthy to see Rome!” and sayings of that kind
fell flat at that moment, when I had no pride left,
and only wanted to complain of the cramp in my
stomach.</p>

<p>When I had an interval of ease, however,
I found such a good joke in an old jest book, that
in spite of my aches and pains, I fairly roared
with laughter, till it brought on the cramp again,
and I had to stop and groan. Oh, what a night
that was! When day dawned at last, I was really
half dead, and could only drag myself on my hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
and knees to the little window, where I called out
in a lamentable voice to the first passerby I saw.
One glance at me was enough. He made the sign
of the Cross and fled for his life, and in fifteen
minutes two sentinels were posted at my door with
orders that on no account was I to cross the
threshold. I could not have gone out if they had
allowed it, but I begged them to go and fetch my
old friend Paillard the notary, at Dornecy, so that
I could make my will before dying. My guards
were so afraid of the plague that they did not even
dare to listen to the sound of my voice, but at last
I found a messenger, a little boy whom I had
caught one day stealing my cherries; he liked me
because I told him he might as well pick some for
me too while he was about it, so now he ran off on
my errand.</p>

<p>I couldn’t tell you what happened for a long
time after that, I just lay all humped up on my
mattress, burning with fever, but after a while I
heard wheels on the road, and a familiar gruff
voice, so I knew Paillard was there, and tried to
raise myself and call to him. I wanted to tell him
to draw up a codicil to my will leaving a larger
share of my money to Martine and little Glodie,
and in the long night I had thought out a way to
do this so that my sons could not contest it. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
great bell of St. Martin’s seemed to be weighing
on my forehead, but I managed to drag myself to
the window, and out on the road I saw two round
red faces staring at me with horror-stricken eyes.
Paillard and Chamaille had rushed in hot haste to
get a sight of their friend before he expired, but
when they did see him, their ardor cooled a little,
and they fell back so as to put the width of the road
between us.</p>

<p>“Heavens!” cried Chamaille; “my poor friend,
your color is something awful.” But the mere sight
of them seemed to restore me, so I called out,
“You look hot, won’t you come in and sit down a
minute?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you, no!” they both said hastily;
“we are all right out here,” and they kept backing
away towards the cart, where Paillard pretended
to fumble with the bit of his old nag, to
cover his embarrassment. Chamaille soon pulled
himself together, for with him it was an everyday
experience to talk with the dying; he first inquired
how I was feeling, and when I said but poorly, he
shook his head.</p>

<p>“Ah, my dear Colas!” said he sadly, “I have
told you more times than I could count that this is
what we must all come to; all flesh is grass, here today
and gone tomorrow, but in the heyday of your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
youth you would never listen to me. Now alas!
your cup is nearly empty, only the dregs remain to
you, but all the same you ought not to be afflicted,
since God does you the honor to summon you before
Him, and I am here to prepare and wash your
soul if perchance it is not perfectly clean and ready.
Come, sinner, the time is short!”</p>

<p>“Vicar,” said I, “I will attend to you in a few
moments.”</p>

<p>“The Chariot of Death will not wait for you.”</p>

<p>“In that case I shall have to go on my two feet.”</p>

<p>“Breugnon, my brother,” said he solemnly, “relinquish
your hold on the things of this world; why
should you cling to them since they are naught but
vanity and vexation of spirit?”</p>

<p>“Too true,” said I, “and it breaks my heart to
think of leaving old friends like you behind me in
the midst of such desolation.”</p>

<p>“We shall meet again!” said he, rolling up his
eyes.</p>

<p>“Let it be soon then! You remember the motto
of the Duke of Guise, ‘Where I lead you follow!’”</p>

<p>“Come, come, Breugnon, time is passing, and so
are you; do you want the father of lies to snap up
your sinful soul for his dinner? He will, if you do
not make your confession quickly, Colas! I entreat
you for my sake!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>“For yours, for God’s, and for my own sake,”
said I, “but first I have a word or two to say to the
notary.”</p>

<p>“Is it possible, Breugnon, that you will make the
Eternal wait for the scrivener?”</p>

<p>“The Eternal has all eternity, so He will not
mind waiting, besides it is more polite for me to
take leave of this world which I am quitting, before
I greet the next world where I am—perhaps—expected.”</p>

<p>As I insisted in spite of all he could say to the
contrary, Master Paillard took out his writing-case
and sat down on a stone by the roadside, surrounded
by a circle of spectators, and all the dogs
in the neighborhood, while I dictated to him my
last will and testament. Having disposed of my
money, I turned my attention to my soul under the
direction of Chamaille, till at last, feeling that my
strength failed me, “Baptiste,” said I, “your words
are heavenly, but what avails the sky to a man
whose throat is dry! Get me a stirrup-cup, for my
soul is just about to spring to the saddle, so one
bottle, if you love me!”</p>

<p>My last words fell on the willing ears of good
neighbors and Christians who brought me not only
one bottle but three, Chablis, Pouilly, and Irancy,
and I, like a sailor setting out on a voyage, let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
down a rope out of my window; they put the wine
in an old basket, tied the rope to its handle, and I
pulled it up gently, my last best friend! After this,
though the others had gone, I was not quite so
lonely, but I kept no count of time, and could not
tell now how the hours passed or rather how they
seemed to be stolen from me, perhaps it was by the
spirits in my trio of bottles, from which came voices
and replies, but Colas Breugnon was not there to
hear them.</p>

<p>Towards midnight I appeared to be seated in a
strawberry bed looking up at the sky through the
branches of a tree. How dark the earth was, and
how the stars twinkled, the moon too was smiling
at me, and all around were twisted distorted old
stems and roots, like a nest of serpents grinning
horribly.—What was I doing there? My head was
spinning, but I seemed to say to myself, “Up with
you, Colas! and lie no longer on that old mattress;
the bottles are empty, out with you to the garden!”
I wanted also to pick some cloves of garlic,
because they are said to be a cure for the plague,
but scarcely had I set foot on the ground when
everything seemed to be enchanted; the sky arched
over me like a huge tree, and from its drooping
branches hung the stars like glittering fruit, and
they all had eyes to look at me; they laughed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
and so did the strawberries; high up among the
leaves was a golden pear all ripe and juicy, and she
sang in a sweet little voice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Grow like me</div>
<div class="verse">From the tree,</div>
<div class="verse">Little man below.</div>
<div class="verse">Reach your hand to mine,</div>
<div class="verse">Cling like stems of vine;</div>
<div class="verse">Shake off all your woe,</div>
<div class="verse">Grow with me</div>
<div class="verse">As we upward go!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>And the heavens and earth seemed like one big
orchard full of fruits all singing, “Grow with me!”</p>

<p>Then I stuck my arms into the soft warm earth
up to the elbows, and sank down till I was all enfolded
from head to heel, as if on my mother’s
breast. From the July night rose the Song of
Songs, the bright bunches of stars swung before
my eyes, and the deep voice of St. Martin’s struck
the hour; twelve o’clock, fourteen, sixteen o’clock?
Surely there was something strange in the old time-piece!
And the star fruit above and below began
to strike too, or was it chiming? with such celestial
sounds that they pierced my heart, and vibrated in
my ears like distant thunder. Then it seemed as I
lay that a tree of Jesse was growing from me and
I mounted with it, up, up among the chiming
branches towards a bright planet dancing on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
highest tree-top, and that I stretched out my arms
to reach it, singing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“You are mine,</div>
<div class="verse">Star wine,</div>
<div class="verse">Spirit of the living vine,</div>
<div class="verse">Halleluia!”</div>
</div></div>

<p>I must have kept on climbing for the greater part
of the night, and from what they tell me I sang for
hours, all sorts of songs, sacred and profane, some
edifying and some very much the reverse; I also
played on the dulcimer as well as on the drum and
trumpet, till at last all the neighborhood came out
to listen and to say, “Poor old Colas, he is dying,
and mad as mad can be.”</p>

<p>The next morning the sun was out of his bed
long before I was, for I never opened my eyes till
near midday, and my first thought was, “Good,
here I am still living!”—not but what my couch
was hard enough, and I still had those horrible
pains in the gizzard, but I was glad enough that
my body was there to put a pain in. “Breugnon,
old man,” said I, “it is a pleasure to see you; if you
had died last night, I should never have got over it.
Good-morning, dear garden, and everything in
you!”</p>

<p>And while I was gloating on my beautiful
melons, I heard some one hailing me from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
other side of the wall. “Breugnon, are you dead
yet?” And there were Paillard and Chamaille
weeping and wailing, and prepared already to proclaim
the virtues of the dear departed.</p>

<p>I crawled slowly from my bed, for my back was
still confoundedly painful, and put my head gently
out of the window. “Here he is,” said I.
“Cuckoo!”</p>

<p>“Colas!” they cried, laughing, while the tears
ran down their faces, and I stuck out my tongue at
them, telling them that I was not dead yet by a
long sight, but if you will believe me those friends
actually kept me shut up for ten days longer, till
they were perfectly certain that I was entirely recovered.
It is only fair to say that they kept me
well supplied with bread and water,—I mean the
kind that Noah drank,—and they came every day
and sat under my window and told me all the news
of town and country. When at last I was set free,
Chamaille wanted me to go at once and return
thanks to St. Roch, who according to him had delivered
me from my mortal sickness. I told him I
thought the saints that saved me had come out of
three quart bottles.</p>

<p>“Well, Colas,” said he, “we will split the
difference, you come first with me to St. Roch
and I will help you afterwards to render due<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
thanks to St. Vineyard.” So we made both these
pious pilgrimages, all three together, for Paillard
insisted on joining us.</p>

<p>“Friends,” said I, “you were not so anxious to
go with me the other day.”</p>

<p>“You know I love you,” said Paillard, “but I
love my own self better, and as the proverb says,
‘My skin fits tighter than my waistcoat.’”</p>

<p>“I am an old coward,” said Chamaille, thumping
himself on the chest, and looking very shamefaced.</p>

<p>“Well then,” said I, “of what use are all the
precepts of religion and of Cato?”</p>

<p>We all looked at each other and laughed. “Life
is sweet,” we cried, “and good men are scarce; if
God thought fit to put us into this world, it is our
duty to stay here as long as we can.”</p>

<small>MY OLD WOMAN’S DEATH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Life</span> tasted good to me after my illness, better
than ever before; the flavor of everything was enhanced,
and I sat down to the world’s table as
Lazarus must have done, with a sharpened appetite.
One day after hours, my foreman and I were
in the shop amusing ourselves with a wrestling
bout, when a neighbor looked in on his way from
Morvan and told me that he had seen my wife
there. I asked him how she was getting along.
He said, “She was leaving when I saw her, making
for a better world as fast as she was able.”</p>

<p>“It won’t be the better for her coming,” said one
would-be wit, and another cried, “Good luck never
comes single; you stay with us, Colas, and she
goes!” And he drank to my health.</p>

<p>I felt somewhat shaky, but not wishing to show
it, I too held up my glass and answered, “When
the gods love a man they take his wife away!”
But I could not swallow the wine, it seemed tasteless,
and suddenly starting up, I seized my stick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
and went out without saying another word. They
called after me, but my heart was in my throat, and
I could not answer. It was all very well to say that
I did not love her, and that we had been constantly
rubbing one another up the wrong way for the last
thirty years; she had lain by my side in the narrow
bed, and from her had sprung the seed I
planted; and now that the pale shadow was near
her, I felt a cold hand laid on my heart; it was as
if a part of my flesh was torn from me, and though
I had often wished to be rid of her, now I pitied her
and myself, and—Heaven forgive me!—I almost
loved her!</p>

<p>I arrived the next day at nightfall, and as soon
as I came near my wife I could see on her face the
hand of the great sculptor, and under the wrinkled
skin the tragic mask of Death. There was a yet
more certain sign, for she smiled as I came in, and
said:</p>

<p>“Why, poor old man, I hope the walk has not
tired you!”</p>

<p>Fancy her speaking to me like that! My
heart sank, and I said to myself that there was
no chance for her as I sat down by the bedside and
took her hand in mine. Her eyes rested on me
with affection, but she was too weak to talk, so I
tried to cheer her up by telling all about my illness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
and how I had got out of the clutches of the plague
after all; but as it was the first she had heard of
it the news proved almost too much for her, and
she turned so faint that I was ready to beat myself
on the head for my stupidity. However, she came
to in a little while, and to my great relief began
to scold me in her trembling voice; she was so weak
that she could not get the words out fast enough,
and it really did me good, and seemed like old
times to be told that I ought to be ashamed of myself,
that a man of any decency would have let his
wife know when he caught the plague, and that I
deserved to die of it all alone on my dunghill. The
others were frightened at her violence, and wanted
to send me out of the room, but I laughed and said
that it would do her good to lose her temper, she
was used to it; then I took her face in my two
hands and kissed her on both cheeks, and will you
believe it? the poor old thing began to cry.</p>

<p>For a long time after that I sat with her alone
in silence, listening to the tick-tack of the death-watch
in the wainscot; at last she tried to speak,
but could only make a feeble murmur.</p>

<p>“Don’t try to talk, old girl,” said I. “I understand;
we have not lived together thirty years for
nothing.”</p>

<p>“I have something I must say to you, Colas, or I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
should not rest easy in Paradise,—I have been very
hard to you, my husband.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” said I, “only a bit sharp, and that
was good for me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I was hard, jealous, quarrelsome; I know
I often made the house too hot for you, but,—Colas,
it was because I loved you!”</p>

<p>“You don’t say so!” said I, patting her hand.
“Well, there are all sorts of ways of loving, but
yours was rather a queer one.”</p>

<p>“I did love you,” she went on, “and you never
returned it, that was why I was cross, and you were
always good-natured. Oh! that laugh of yours,
Colas! You don’t know how it made me suffer,
till sometimes I really thought it would kill me.
You covered yourself with it like a hood, and storm
as I might, I could never get at you.”</p>

<p>“My poor old dear!” said I; “that was because
I do not like water!”</p>

<p>“There you go again laughing! But I don’t
mind it now that the chill of the grave is upon me;
your laughter seems something warm and comforting,
it does not anger me now,—and, Colas, say
that you forgive me.”</p>

<p>“You were an honest, hard-working, faithful
wife to me,” said I earnestly; “perhaps you were
not always as sweet as sugar, but in this world, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
know, one does not expect perfection, God keeps
that for Himself up yonder; but when it came to
hard times, you always backed me up. I used to
think you really good-looking when I saw how you
threw yourself into your work, whatever happened.
Now I don’t want you to torment yourself about
the past, it’s bad enough to have lived through it,
but since it is all over, we might as well let the
burden slip from our shoulders and cast all our
cares on the Master. We have come to the end,
and can take breath and look about us for a nice
soft hole where we can sleep the sleep of the just
which means, I suppose, of the good workers.”</p>

<p>While I was talking, she lay with folded arms,
and her eyes shut, and when I stopped she held out
her hand. “Wake me tomorrow morning,” she
said. “And now good-night, my dear!”</p>

<p>Then she stretched herself out in the bed, and,
neat as ever, she drew the sheet smoothly up to
her chin, with the crucifix resting on her breast;—poor
little woman, how thin she was! And there
she lay, all ready, staring straight in front of her,
waiting for the summons. It seemed that after so
many years of effort her poor old body deserved
some repose, but alas! there was one more trial in
store for her. The landlady suddenly rushed into
the room calling to me to come quickly, and when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
I did not at once understand, and told her to speak
lower, it seemed as if the dying woman from her
funeral couch could see beyond and above me, for
she raised herself stiffly like him whom Jesus awakened,
stretched out her arms, and cried, “Glodie!”</p>

<p>Her cry went through my heart, and as I heard
a hoarse choking cough from the next room, I
understood only too well, and ran in to find my
poor little lark struggling with the croup, her
cheeks all flushed and burning, as she put her hands
up to her throat, and with wild eyes implored us
to help her.</p>

<p>Oh, what a dreadful night that was! Even now
a week later my knees give way under me when I
think of it. Can it be that the Omnipotent causes
the pain of such poor little creatures? How can He
bear to see their eyes full of wondering reproach
when it is in His power to save them? I can understand
that since we are made in the image of our
Creator, He may sometimes be cruel, as we are, or
at least not always compassionate,—perhaps even
capricious,—but grown-up men and women must
set their teeth and take whatever comes to them,
and they can always resist when things go too far,
but that He should torment these helpless lamblings
is more than we can tolerate, and if this goes
on, Lord, some day or other we shall withdraw our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
allegiance. If such crimes are possible it must be
because You are blind, or else there is no Father
up there!—Pardon, I must take that back, it is a
little more than I intended. If You did not exist,
I could not speak to You as I am doing, and we
have had many a discussion, which always ended
in my having the last word.—During the whole of
that terrible night, I called to You, threatened,
cursed, denied, implored You; clasped my hands in
prayer, or shook my fist at You, but no voice came
from above in answer, in spite of all I could do
nothing seemed to touch You, till at last I cried
out in desperation, “Lord, if You will not hear me,
I will turn to some one less hard-hearted!”</p>

<p>Martine, the child’s mother, had been taken with
the pains of labor on her journey, and had been
obliged to stop at Dornecy, leaving Glodie to the
care of her grandmother; so now I had to watch
alone with the old landlady. It seemed as if our
little martyr would pass away with the night, and
when dawn came I felt that there was but one thing
left to do. Looking out I saw that it rained and
a high wind blew through the doorway, but none
the less, I made the sign of the Cross and lifted
my darling from her pillow where she lay so exhausted
that she had no further strength to struggle,
but only panted a little like a bird in one’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
hand. She weighed no more than a feather as I
carried her out, where a rose brushed against her in
passing,—that’s a sign of Death, they say,—but I
crossed myself and went out sheltering her as best
I could against the tempest. The landlady went
first carrying presents, and so we came to the
wood, where we found what we sought; a tall aspen
standing high above the reeds on the edge of the
swamp. Once, twice, three times we circled round
the tree; the child lay quiet in my arms, only her
teeth shook together like the leaves about us. We
tied one end of a ribbon to her wrist, and fastened
the other end to the aspen, and then the woman
and I repeated this incantation:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“Shake, shake,</div>
<div class="verse">My sickness take.</div>
<div class="verse">By the sweet Trinity,</div>
<div class="verse">Thus do I order thee;</div>
<div class="verse">But if thou reject my suit</div>
<div class="verse">Ax shall soon destroy thy root.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Then the old woman dug a hole between the roots
of the tree, in which she poured a pint of wine,
and put in two cloves of garlic, a slice of bacon, and
a copper penny; then we filled my hat with rushes,
laid it on the ground, and again marched three
times round it; the third time we spat in it and said,
“Catch croup, cursèd toads.” Then we turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
toward home, but near the edge of the wood we
laid Glodie at the foot of a thorn tree, and put up
a prayer to God’s Son in the name of the Holy
Thorn.</p>

<p>The little one was unconscious when we got back
to the house, but we felt that we had done all we
could; and it seemed too that my wife would not
quit this world as long as Glodie remained in it.
“Jesus, Mary,” cried she, “I cannot go until I
know that our child will recover, surely she must
be cured, I swear it!”</p>

<p>Poor old dear, she was not as sure as she said, for
she kept on praying, with a strength that astonished
me when I remembered that I had thought her
at her last breath the night before. “If that is the
last, it is a good long one,” said I, and was ashamed
of myself for laughing at such a moment, but I
could not help it. You cannot, of course, keep off
suffering by laughter, but a Frenchman will always
meet pain with a smile, and sad or merry you will
find he has his eyes wide open; so, though I put a
good face on it, my anxiety was as great as that of
the poor old woman who was twisting and groaning
in her bed. I tried to soothe her as we do
children, tucking up the bedclothes which she had
disordered; but she pushed me away, and told me
that if I was worth my salt, I would do <i>something</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
for Glodie. “You cured yourself of the plague,”
said she, crying, “and yet you can do nothing for
our darling! You are the one that ought to have
died!”</p>

<p>“True enough, my dear, and I would give my
skin to save her, but it is too old and cracked to
be of use to anybody; all we are good for now is
to suffer, the pair of us, and be as brave as we can,
it may be some help to our little girl.”</p>

<p>My wife leaned her head against mine, and our
tears dropped together as we felt in the room the
sweeping wings of the Archangel of Death.</p>

<p>All at once the sound of those great wings grew
fainter, and as if by miracle hope dawned again.
God had compassion on us, or the tender Jesus
to whom I had prayed so fervently;—or else those
elder gods of the earth and forest perhaps had
heard our cries? Even our offering to the aspen
may have helped us? But no matter what the reason,
all we knew certainly was that from this moment
the child’s fever left her, once more she could
draw her breath easily. Death had released her
throat from the clutch of his pale fingers, she was
given back to us! We did not know to whom we
owed our thanks for this great mercy, but our
hearts were filled with gratitude, and with tears
of joy we sang “Nunc Dimittis,” and then my poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
old woman said, “Now I can go.” She fell back on
her pillow quite exhausted, the light in her eyes
faded, her features grew sharp and hollow, and she
sank down into the dark river, through which I
could still seem to see the outline of her body;—until
life was gone. I stooped and closed her eyelids,
kissed her brow, and folded her workworn
hands together for the rest they had never known
till now, and turning from the extinguished lamp,
I went to watch by the little flickering flame which
was to be henceforward the light of my dwelling.</p>

<p>Glodie slept, and as I sat by her side I could not
help the thoughts that rushed over me:—Why is
this little creature so unutterably dear that nothing
seems worth while without her, and with her the
worst that could happen would be bearable? Hers
is the only life that matters; in comparison my own
seems valueless, and yet here am I active of body
and mind, with some talents, and what is even
better, plenty of good sense; loving life, and made
to enjoy it, in short a good Burgundian workman,
and I would freely sacrifice all this for the sake of
a little creature I do not even know; who is nothing
as yet but a sweet face, a pretty plaything, but
who will be something perhaps,—and for this possibility
I am willing to give up my own “I am.”
Ah! it is because in this “perhaps” lies enfolded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
the fine flower of my existence, the best that is in
me, and when I lie below the sod, and worms have
destroyed this body, then will arise another self
better and happier than the old one, yes, better, because
I shall serve as a stepping-stone from which
to see more clearly than I did.—You who are born
of me, and will see the light when my eyes can no
more behold it; through you I shall taste the vintage
of the long future years, through you I shall
enjoy the known and the unknown. All around
me is passing as I shall pass, but you will lead me,
ever farther and upward. I am no longer bound
to my little holding here on earth; beyond my
fields, beyond my life, the lines of the future stretch
out into the infinite; they cover the years to come
as the Milky Way covers the night sky. I have
sown the seed of future harvests, and in you who
will live after me I put my desire and my eternal
hope.</p>

<small>THE FIRE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="right">15th of August.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I can</span> hardly bear to tell of what happened today,
and I feel as if I could never really reconcile myself
to it; but as I always say, “Cheer up, Colas!
a brave heart will carry you through everything.”</p>

<p>I have often heard it said that summer’s rain
gives no pain; but you would agree that it gives no
gain, either, if you could see me after a season when
one storm after another has beat on my devoted
head; here I am without shoes or shirt to cover
me,—but let me tell you all about it.—I was just
pulling myself together after a double trial, you remember?
Glodie had been cured of the croup and
my poor wife of all the troubles of this world; when
a fresh blow fell on me at the hands, I suppose, of
the heavenly powers,—unless there is some woman
up there who has a grudge against me?—but this
time I am stripped to the skin, and glad enough to
have that left on my bones. I had been in no hurry
to come home while Glodie was recovering from
her illness; a child’s convalescence is so charming!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
It is as if one saw a fresh creation, everything looks
smooth and white like a new-laid egg; and as I
had little to do, I went to market by way of amusement,
and just to know what was going on in the
world. One day I heard something which made
me prick up my ears like an old mule. They said
that a great fire was raging at Clamecy, that it had
spread to the suburb of Beuvron, and that the
whole place was burning up like a bundle of kindling
wood. Naturally I asked eagerly about my
own house, but could hear nothing further, and
felt as if I was on hot coals,—probably from association
of ideas,—though all my friends tried to
calm me by saying that my house could be in no
danger, or I should have heard of it by this time,
that ill news travels fast, and that I was certainly
not the only fool in Beuvron.</p>

<p>In spite of all this a voice told me that my house
was on fire;—I could almost smell it, and without
further words I started off, thinking as I went how
careless I had been, to leave everything at sixes
and sevens. Other conflagrations had been caused
by the enemy, and I always had had warning
enough to transport my most precious possessions
across the bridge, and get them behind walls, so
that I saved my money, my best pieces of work,
furniture and tools, and all those things that people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
accumulate, and which are dear to us because they
are like fragments of a happy past. This time, however,
nothing had been placed in safety, and I could
almost hear my old woman’s voice from the other
world, berating me for my stupidity. As I trudged
along, I tried to find a good answer to these reproaches,
but my only excuse was that I had been
in a hurry to get to her sick-bed. I endeavored to
persuade myself also, that there was no real cause
for alarm, but the thought kept coming back and
back, like a fly that settles on your nose, till I was
all in a cold perspiration, in spite of the fact that
I was walking at a good round pace. As I climbed
up the long wooded hill just after you pass Villiers,
I saw a chaise coming down; I could not tell who
was driving at first, but when it got nearer, I recognized
Jojot, the miller from Moulot.</p>

<p>He pulled up as soon as he caught sight of me.</p>

<p>“Poor old boy!” he cried, waving his whip,
and though I expected it, the wind was just
knocked out of me, and I could not say a word,
but stood there like a stick, with my mouth
open.</p>

<p>“There is no use in your keeping on, Colas; you
might as well go back where you came from. The
whole thing is burned, flat as the palm of your
hand; it will only make you sick to see it.” Every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
word seemed to wring my heartstrings, but I tried
to put a good face on it, and said:</p>

<p>“I know, I know, but I must go on all the
same.”</p>

<p>“What for, if the whole place is in ruins?”</p>

<p>“I want to pick up the pieces.”</p>

<p>“There aren’t any pieces,” said he, “not so
much as you could put on the end of your finger.”</p>

<p>“Jojot,” said I, “there is no use your trying to
persuade me that there is absolutely nothing left!
My apprentices and the neighbors would not stand
by, and see all I have in the world burnt to ashes,
without trying to save a few sticks of furniture for
me!”</p>

<p>“You don’t know anything about it,” cried he.
“Why, your neighbors are the very ones who set
your house on fire!”</p>

<p>I was perfectly crushed at this news, and he, with
the sort of perverse satisfaction one has in making
out anything as bad as possible, went on to tell me
the whole story from the beginning.</p>

<p>“You must know,” said he, “that the plague is
at the bottom of the trouble; our town Councilors,
the Provost, and the whole crew of them, fled
away, and left us as sheep without a shepherd, and
the people at this lost their heads completely, so
that when a fresh case of the disease broke out in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
Beuvron, some one raised a cry to burn down the
infected houses. No sooner said than done, and
naturally they began with yours, Colas, because
you were not on hand to stop them. The more
they burned, the better they seemed to like it; you
know how a mob is when it once gets going, men
seem to be drunk with love of destruction, so they
went on from bad to worse, as if they were crazy;
throwing everything they could lay hands on into
the flames, and dancing round them like savages.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">‘On the bridge of Clamecy town,</div>
<div class="verse">See us dancing up and down.’</div>
</div></div>

<p>you know the children’s song. It was really awful
to see such madness, and yet it was a kind of contagion.
I’ll bet you would have danced yourself
if you had been there, to see what a blaze your
shop made with all the dry wood you had in it.”</p>

<p>“I wish I had been there,” said I. “It must
have been a grand sight.”</p>

<p>And the funny part of it was that I really did
think so. I thought something else too: that this
time I was ruined; but wild horses would not have
dragged it out of me before Jojot. He was puzzled,
and looked as if he did not know what to make
of me, half with that queer pleasure we have in
the misfortunes of our fellow-man, and half with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
pity, for he is really a good sort, and a friend of
mine. I turned to go.</p>

<p>“They ought to have kept a thing like that for
the midsummer bonfire,” said I.</p>

<p>“Are you really going on?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m going on, Jojot.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re an odd fish—you do hate to be like
other people.” And he whipped up his horse and
drove off down the hill, while I stepped out bravely
in the opposite direction as long as he was in sight;
but as soon as I got round the corner, my knees
seemed to give way under me, and I let myself
fall like a lump by the roadside.</p>

<p>The next moments were among the worst that I
have ever had to bear, and as there was nobody to
see me, I just let myself go, and bewailed my misfortune.</p>

<p>“I have lost everything in the world,” thought I.
My home,—the house was full of dear memories,—and
the hope of ever having another of my own;
all my savings, which it took me years to get together,
bit by bit, and which were so much the
more valuable to me, and worst of all, my independence
is gone; for now of course, I shall have
to live with one of my children, and I don’t know
which of us will hate it the most. It is the one
thing I have always been resolved against, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
worst that could happen. There is no use telling
me that I love them, and they love me,—I know
all that, but young people and old interfere with
each other, and it is natural and proper for a bird
to sit on its own nest, and hatch out its own eggs in
its own way. Respect for the old is all very well,
or rather it makes a difficulty, for you are not on an
equality with people when you are obliged to show
them respect. I have tried to behave so that my
five children should not have too much respect for
me, and I think I have succeeded pretty well, but
there must always be a distance between us.
Parents come and go in their children’s lives, like
strangers from a far country; there can never be
perfect understanding from one generation to another,
and too often there is, on the contrary, interference
and irritation.</p>

<p>It seems a dreadful thing to say, but it is
not wise to tempt Providence, and put too great
a strain on the love, even of our best and
dearest. It is asking a great deal of human nature;
not that I have anything to complain of in
my children, who have always been good to me,
but I don’t want to impose myself on them, for my
own sake, as well as theirs;—and then it goes
against the grain with me to take back the least
part of what I have given them; it looks like asking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
for repayment, and that is a sort of thing that
sticks in the throat of a man who has never owed
anything to anybody but himself. I want to be
master in my own house, to come and go without
question; and it would kill me to think that some
one was counting every mouthful I ate; I should
soon become a broken-down, good-for-nothing old
man. Far rather would I live on the charity of
strangers than on that of my children, never being
sure that they kept me of their own free will. I
would rather die outright than be such a burden to
them.... I sat there for a long time, like an old
tree that has been cut down at the roots; and there
was precious little of my boasted philosophy left.
I suffered in my pride, and in my affections; in
what was best and worst in me; accumulations
from the past, and hopes for the future, had all
gone up in smoke, but I knew that I must walk
in the path before me, however thorny it might
prove; there could be no escape.</p>

<p>Not far off above the tops of the trees, my sad
eyes lighted on the towers of the Château of
Cuncy, and I felt that there they had found something
on which they might rest with pleasure. For
many years I had worked for the good lord Philibert
de Cuncy; and the castle was full of fine furniture,
woodwork, and stairways, which I had executed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
at his order. He was a queer man, and I
sometimes got into hot water with him. Would
you believe it? once he wanted me to make portrait
statues of his mistresses and himself all in costumes
dating from the days of Adam and Eve!
Another time he took it into his head to have the
stag’s antlers in his armory attached to busts
representing all the unlucky husbands in the vicinity.
We had a good laugh over it, but it was not
always so easy to please him; as fast as I finished
one thing, he wanted me to begin another, and very
seldom did I see the color of his money. Never
mind! he was a genuine lover of art, and of woman,
and much in the same way too. In this I was much
of his mind, for I have always thought a man
should love a work of art, as he does his mistress,
with the flesh as well as the spirit.</p>

<p>It was a consolation to me to think that so much
of my best work survived, now that the rest had
perished, even if it was not paid for; and I felt a
longing to go and see the fruit of my past labors,
hoping that it might make life seem less hard to
me. At the castle I was well known, and they let
me go where I would. The Master was away, they
said, but I told them I had some measurements to
take for new work, and I knew where to find the
children of my brains and my fingers, though it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
was some time since I had seen them. As long as
an artist feels in himself the power of fresh creation,
he does not care to dwell on his former productions,
and besides, the last time I was here,
the Master had made some excuse to prevent my
coming in. I thought at the time, that he looked
rather queer, but suspected perhaps that he was
hiding some married woman, and as I was quite
sure it was not my wife, I thought no more about
it; besides, no one at Cuncy ever pays much attention
to the Master’s vagaries; he is a little cracked,
they say, and let it go at that.</p>

<p>I had not mounted ten steps of the staircase before
I was struck motionless, like Lot’s wife, by the
sight which met my eyes. The fine carving which
ran along the banisters, representing vines and
flowering branches, was all hacked and disfigured
so that I could hardly believe it, and had to touch
and feel the rough edge to convince myself that
these injuries had been made deliberately with a
knife or hatchet. My breath came short, and I
trembled to think of what yet might be in store for
me, but I took the rest of the stair four steps at a
time, and burst open the great doors on the landing.
As I looked down the long range of apartments,
I saw that my worst fears were realized. In
the armory, the dining-hall, and the state bedroom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
my beautiful little figurines had all been mutilated,
shorn of their noses, their arms, or their legs. Silly
inscriptions, names or dates, were cut deep in the
panels of the wardrobes, on the chimney breasts, or
across the fluted pilasters. At the head of the long
gallery stood a charming group,—a nymph of the
Yonne, with her bare knee on the neck of a shaggy
lioness. This they had used as a target, so that it
was all battered by shots from an arquebus. Some
of the faces were ornamented with mustaches, or
had low jokes scrawled upon them with wine stains
or ink. Everywhere were gashes, chips, or rubbish;
all that loneliness, idleness, or stupidity could
suggest to the mind of a rich idiot, on the lookout
for some new amusement, destruction and disfigurement
being the only things that could come
into the head of a creature too dull to be of any use
himself in the world. It is lucky that he was not
there, for in the first transport of rage I believe
that I should have killed him. I could not speak
at first, but the veins of my neck swelled up, and
my eyes started from my head like a lobster’s. Another
moment, and I really should have burst! but
fortunately I managed to let out an oath or two,
and then my rage came in a flood, and I screamed,
stamped, and swore like a man demented.</p>

<p>“Dog! beast! ruffian!” cried I. “I gave you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
these lovely children of my art, to ornament your
vile den, and look what you have done to them! I
thought that they would adorn your house and
carry on my name for generations, and here they
are, spoiled, tortured, and violated! What joy
was mine when I evoked all these from the enduring
wood, and worked with loving care to make
them beautiful, perfect in every limb,—and now see
them, thus soiled and mutilated from head to foot,
defaced and ruined. Poor dears! your own father
scarcely knows you, one would think that you had
all been to the wars!”</p>

<p>And then I put up a fervent prayer to Heaven
(which was perhaps superfluous), entreating that
I might not enter Paradise, but be sent to the
nethermost hell, where I might assist Lucifer in
tormenting my enemy. “Ah!—ha! when I think
of this brutal destroyer, how I should love to stick
a spit through him and twirl him before a slow
fire!”</p>

<p>The steward Andoche came in, while I was still
foaming with rage; he begged me as an old acquaintance
to calm myself, and led me from the
room, saying what he could to console me.</p>

<p>“They are only bits of wood, after all,” he said.
“It is not worth while for you to excite yourself
so for things like that; and what would you do if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
you had to live here, like us, with this lunatic? If
he wants to knock anything about,—and after all
a man must have some pleasure,—why should he
not kick these chunks of wood, for which you got a
fair price, instead of good Christians like you and
me?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care how much he beats you,” said I.
“I had rather have been flogged myself than have
had him injure this wood into which I had breathed
the breath of life. Do you think a man cares for
his bones? It is his thought that is sacred to him,
and he who kills that is thrice guilty!” Carried
away by my own eloquence, I might have kept on
like this for hours, but I saw that Andoche did not
grasp a word of it, and indeed seemed to think that
I was nearly as cracked as his Master. I turned
on the threshold and gave a last look, as one may
say, at the field of battle, where lay my poor noseless
creations; there was Andoche with his pitying
smile, and here was I wasting my breath in cursing
at these dummies. It struck me all at once as so
deucedly funny, that I just laughed in Andoche’s
face, and went off in a gust of merriment which
seemed to carry away my anger and my pain along
with it.</p>

<p>I struck out towards Clamecy, musing as I went,
“This time,” thought I, “they may as well stick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
me under ground; for there is nothing left of the
old man but his skin. Hold on, though, there may
be something worth while inside of that,—I remember
a story of a fellow who was besieged, and
they told him to yield, or they would kill all his
children. He answered that if they did, he knew
how to make a lot of new ones. That is my position
exactly. In the dry places of the earth we
artists have sown grain which wild beasts and birds
of the air come to devour, because they do not
know how to create, and can only feed on the works
of others; but let them trample and uproot as much
as they will, I have a store from which I can replenish
the fruitful soil. Let the wheat ripen or
die, it does not matter, for my eyes are fixed, not
on the past, but on the future, and when the day
comes, as it will, when none are left to me of all
my members, when the sight of my eyes is dimmed,
and my hands have lost their cunning, then when
that time comes, Colas, you will have ceased to
be. Is it possible to imagine a Breugnon, who cannot
work or feel, who does not laugh or spring
from the ground with both feet at once? No, then
he will be only a withered nut, you can throw the
old shell into the fire!”</p>

<p>I was so much comforted by these reflections
that when I reached the top of the last hill as you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
go towards Clamecy I went on gaily, throwing my
feet out, and twirling my stick with a jaunty air,
when I saw in the distance a boy running towards
me, seemingly in much distress. As he came
nearer, I knew him for my youngest apprentice, a
lad about thirteen years old, Robinet, called Binet;
certainly as idle a youngster as ever stared out of
a window at the girls, when he should have been
hard at work. Twenty times a day I had to cuff
him for his laziness, but he was a clever little monkey,
and his agile fingers could turn out astonishingly
good things when he liked; and then his
funny face with its wide mouth and turned-up nose,
was so attractive that, for the life of me, I could
not be really angry with him. He knew it, the
young rascal! and when I hit him a good clip, he
would just shake his ears like a donkey, and in ten
minutes was as bad as ever.</p>

<p>Imagine my surprise when I saw that he was crying,
the large drops streaming in rivulets down his
cheeks, and before I could say a word, he flung his
arms round my neck, blubbering, and bedewing me
with his tears, like a Triton in a fountain.</p>

<p>“Stand off!” cried I. “What on earth is the
matter with you? And, for goodness’ sake, blow
your nose, first, if you want to kiss me!”</p>

<p>Then as I saw that, far from stopping, he let himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
slip to the ground and lay there, sobbing louder
than ever, I became really alarmed, and raised him,
so that I saw that one hand was wrapped in a
bloody rag, that his eyebrows were singed, and his
clothes torn and dusty.</p>

<p>“Come, my boy, what is the matter? What mischief
have you been up to this time?”—I had
really forgotten my disaster.</p>

<p>“Oh, Master!—the fire! I can’t bear to tell
you,” said he, weeping, and when I realized that the
poor child was unhappy on my account, because my
house was burned down, I cannot tell you what a
comfort it was to me.</p>

<p>“My poor boy!” said I, “don’t cry any longer.”</p>

<p>He thought that I had not understood, and told
me more calmly that my workshop and my house
were burned to the ground.</p>

<p>“That’s an old story by now,” said I, patting him
on the back. “You are the fourth or fifth person
who has told me of it. Well! it’s hard luck, that’s
all I can say, but I never thought you cared so
much about the old shop. Honor bright, now,
didn’t you dance around it, like the others, while it
was burning?”</p>

<p>The way I was taking it had made him feel much
better, but at this he shook off my hand indignantly.
“You don’t believe a word of it, Master; Cagnat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
and I did all we could to put it out, but there were
only two of us, and Cagnat was sick with the fever;
he got out of his bed to help, and we tried to hold
the door of the house against the crowd, but what
was the use? They threw us down, and trampled
us under foot like a herd of wild cattle! We were
swept off our feet as if a flood had gone over us,
and when Cagnat managed to pick himself up, and
tried to prevent them from setting fire to the house,
they very nearly killed him.</p>

<p>“I got into the workshop somehow, though it
was already in a blaze, flaming like a torch from top
to bottom, with long red banners of fire streaming
from the roof and windows. The smoke nearly
choked me, and I thought I should be burnt to a
crisp, but I made one bound into a heap of shavings,
which were so hot that they set my breeches on
fire, and it did not take me long to jump out of
them again. I hit my head such a crack on the
corner of the workbench that it half stunned me,
but not for long; all around the fire was crackling
and roaring, and outside I could hear the cries of
those mad devils.</p>

<p>“I crawled on my hands and knees towards your
figure of St. Marie Madeleine, which I saw near
me; I could not bear to see the flames licking up
over her little rounded body, and her long beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
hair!—I just jumped at her, beat out the sparks
with my fingers, and caught her in my arms as if
she had been alive. ‘Dear St. Madelon! treasure
of my heart,’ cried I, ‘don’t be afraid, I will save
you,—and myself too, if I have luck!’ There was
not a minute to spare, for by this time the roof was
falling in, and I could not get out the way I came.
But I spied the round loophole in the wall towards
the river, struck the glass a blow with my fist, and
jumped through it with my saint, as if it had been
a paper hoop! A tight fit, I can tell you! but out
we popped, splash, to the bottom of the Beuvron!
Luckily the bottom is not far from the top, and very
soft and muddy, so Madeleine did not so much as
bump her pretty head, but as I had not the sense to
let go of her, she dragged me down face first, till
I was so full of slime and river water that it was
a hard job to pull myself out with the lady. So
here we are, at last, Master, and I only wish that
I could have saved more for you!”</p>

<p>He had a bundle under his arm wrapped up in
an old waistcoat, and when he carefully unrolled
it, I saw the sweet face of my little saint, not much
the worse, except for her scorched toes. Up to this
time I had not wept for all the misfortunes that
had fallen on me, but at the sight I was touched to
the quick, and taking Madeleine and the boy in my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
arms, I kissed them both, and cried, till the tears
ran down my cheeks.</p>

<p>“What became of Cagnat?” I asked when I had
recovered myself a little, and reading the answer in
the boy’s face, I knelt down, and put my lips to the
earth in honor of a brave spirit.</p>

<p>“God reward you both!” I cried, as I looked
at the lad still clasping the statue in his bandaged
arms, and I thought, “These will last, the souls of
these children, on which I have wrought my impress;—wood
and stone may be destroyed, but this
joy no man can take from me!”</p>

<small>THE RIOT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="right">August 30.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we were a little calmed down, I said to
Robinet, “What is done is done, let us see now
what is before us.” For I always think that the
best way to act in the present is to look upon yesterday’s
doings as ancient history. I had been
away from Clamecy about three weeks, and I made
him sit down and tell me all that had happened in
the interval. The town had been under a double
curse, the plague and fear, and when the pestilence
abated, fear seemed the more dangerous. Bandits
flocked from all the surrounding country, to prey
upon the unfortunate place; the people were so terrified
that they offered no resistance, and those of
the baser sort, driven out their wits by fright, even
joined themselves to the robbers.</p>

<p>The law had become a dead letter, for of our four
Aldermen, one died, two fled, and the Public Prosecutor
had also bolted. The Commandant at the
Citadel was brave enough, but old, and crippled by
gout, besides, having no more brains than you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
could put in a thimble, he had allowed himself to
be torn in pieces.</p>

<p>The only official that remained in the town was
the fourth Alderman, a man named Racquin, who
finding himself deserted by his colleagues, and opposed
by this raging mob, was weak, or cunning
enough, to yield to it, instead of trying to put a
stop to its depredations. He even allowed the mob
to set fire to the houses of men against whom he
had a grudge for one reason or another, myself
among the number.</p>

<p>“What are the citizens doing all this time?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing, now that their leaders are gone; they
are like lambs led to the slaughter.”</p>

<p>“Well, how about me, Binet? This old ram has
some fight left in him still, so come along!”</p>

<p>“You are crazy, Master! What could you do,
one man, against hundreds of brigands?”</p>

<p>“Do?—the best I can, of course; why should I
be afraid of robbers, now that I have not a penny
left in the world? Come on, I say.”</p>

<p>Now, would you believe it? that boy actually
turned a handspring on the road for joy, in spite
of his burned hand, and bruises, and began to dance
about and shout that this was the greatest sport he
had ever heard of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>“Hooray!” he cried; “we’ll chase these beggars
off the face of the earth!”</p>

<p>“Stop! you young monkey,” said I. “You’ll be
swinging soon, perhaps, by your neck instead of
by your tail, so keep still, and mind what I tell
you.... I’m off for Clamecy now by myself, and
you must make the best of your way to Dornecy.
When you get there, find Magistrate Nicole, our
alderman. He thought it prudent to run, I know,
but he is kind-hearted, even if he does love himself
better than his neighbor, and there are things he
prizes still more,—viz.: his goods and chattels,
which are in the greatest peril, as you will not fail
to tell him.</p>

<p>“When you have seen him, push on to Sardy,
to Master Courtignon, the Procurator; you’ll find
him in his house with a pigeon-cote there; let him
know that his mansion in Clamecy, with all it contains,
will be burnt to the ground this very night,
unless he comes back;—that will fetch him, I promise
you! But I don’t need to give you lessons in
lying, you young rascal! I’ll be bound you know
well enough what to say to them.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I don’t mind a lie or two, but the
fact is, Master, I would rather not leave you
alone.”</p>

<p>“As if a snip like you would be of any protection!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
Seriously, Binet, the best thing you can do
for me is to get help, so hurry off as fast as you can,
and when you have done my errand, join me at the
town.”</p>

<p>“Old Courtignon and Nicole shall be brought
back,” he cried, “if I have to drag them here by
the hair of their heads; but just tell me one thing,
Master,—what are we going to do with them when
they get here?”</p>

<p>“You will see,” said I with an air of profound
mystery, though I knew myself no more than the
babe unborn what was to be the outcome. The
sun had set in a bank of red clouds, and the lovely
summer evening was closing in when I got to the
town about eight o’clock; but fine as it was, there
was not a soul about; no guards and no loungers
outside the market gate; so I walked boldly up the
High Street, where the only living thing I met was
a half-starved cat, which fled when it saw me. The
houses, all tightly closed, turned blind eyes on the
street, with doors and windows barred; and the
only sound I heard was the echo of my own footsteps.</p>

<p>“I am too late,” I said to myself, “they are all
dead.” Just then I thought I heard a rustling behind
the shutters, so I banged on the nearest door
and shouted, “Let me in!” Getting no answer I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
tried another house and another, rattling the handles
and knocking loudly with my stick, but not a
door was opened. I could hear faint noises inside
as if mice were stirring, and I understood that the
miserable cowards were all hiding. This made me
so angry that I cried out, “Denis Saulsoy, old
man, if you don’t open the door, I’ll beat it down!
It is I, Breugnon.”</p>

<p>At my name all the shutters flew open as if by
magic; and I saw a row of frightened faces all
along Market Street, like a lot of onions lying on
the window sills. They stared at me as if I were
the most beautiful thing in creation, and as the terror
faded from their eyes, they looked so pleased
that I flattered myself that it was from affection
for me; but the fact was, the sight of any one there
at that hour was reassuring. Then ensued a very
interesting dialogue between Breugnon and the
onions; they all talked at once, and I replied as best
I was able. They wanted to know where I came
from, what I was doing, where I was going, how I
got in, and how I meant to get out? To which I
answered that I was glad to find that their tongues
were still in working order, though their courage
seemed somewhat rusty.</p>

<p>“I want to talk to you,” I cried. “Come out!
It is a charming evening, what are you all sticking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
in the house for,—has somebody stolen your
breeches?”</p>

<p>“Breugnon,” they said in a frightened whisper,
“did you see any one in the streets?”</p>

<p>“Whom did you expect to see, idiots?”</p>

<p>“The brigands; they are burning everything in
Béyant.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go and stop them then, you
fools?”</p>

<p>“We have to stay here to protect our houses.”</p>

<p>“The best way to protect your own houses is to
go out and fight for other people’s; don’t you see
that when the brigands have burnt down the rest
of the houses, they will take yours? Your time will
come, never fear!”</p>

<p>“Master Racquin told us that the best thing we
could do was to keep quiet till order was re-established
by the Duke of Nevers.”</p>

<p>“A lot of water will run under the bridges before
the Duke leaves his own business to look after
ours; we shall all be burned to a cinder by that
time. Come, come! We ought to fight for our
skin, if it is worth anything.”</p>

<p>They kept on for some time making objections,
chirping like birds from window to window, declaring
that the enemy was numerous and powerful,
and that we were weak and had no one to lead us;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
till I lost all patience, and swore that I would not
stand there in the street any longer gaping at them.</p>

<p>“Do you think I am here to serenade you?” I
cried. “Let the women stay up there, to take care
of your houses, they are quite equal to that. But
if there are any men among you, come down and
fight, or, by the God that made me, I will set fire to
you myself with my own hands!”</p>

<p>At last one braver than the rest stuck his nose
out of the door, half laughing, and then they all
came out one after the other, and stood round me
in a circle.</p>

<p>“Are you quite cured of the plague?”</p>

<p>“As right as a trivet.”</p>

<p>“And has no one attacked you?”</p>

<p>“Only a lot of geese, but who cares for their
hissing? Listen, my friends, you see I am here all
safe and sound; don’t you think that there has been
enough of all this nonsense? It is time to go to
work, and now, some of you tell me where we can
go to plan for what must be done.”</p>

<p>“You can come to my forge, if you like,” said
Gangnot, and led the way; soon we were all gathered
there in the darkness, with the door tight shut.
The place smelt of burnt horn and horses, and a
lantern standing on the rough floor threw our
monstrous shadows on the smoky beams of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
roof. At first no one dared to speak a word, and
then they all broke out and talked at once, until
Gangnot seized his great hammer and struck a
resounding blow on the anvil, which shook the loud
voices again into silence; whereupon I managed to
make myself heard.</p>

<p>“Friends,” said I, “don’t waste your breath in
telling me what has happened, for I know as much
as you do about it;—you say the brigands are
here,—I say we must throw them out; you say the
mob is on their side,—well, what of that? Mobs
are men, just like you and me, who want to wet
their throats when they see others drinking. We
are told it is a sin to tempt Providence, but it is
still worse to dangle a lot of rich booty before the
eyes of poor devils, who have not one penny to rub
against another; they may not be thieves themselves,
but they have no objection to profit by the
stealings of others. You know, there are all sorts
of people in the world, and as the Lord says, we
must divide the sheep from the goats.”</p>

<p>“Master Racquin is an Alderman, and he ordered
us to do nothing,” said some of the more
timid. “The whole authority of the city rests in
his hands, you know, and now that the Lieutenant,
the Procurator, and all the others are absent, he is
charged to keep order.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>“Well, does he do it?”</p>

<p>“He tries his best.”</p>

<p>“I ask you, has he kept the town in order? No!
Well then, we will do it ourselves!”</p>

<p>“Master Racquin has solemnly promised us that
if we keep perfectly quiet, all our property shall
be protected, and the disturbances be confined to
the suburbs.”</p>

<p>“And how is he going to keep that promise?”</p>

<p>“He was forced to make some kind of a treaty
with the brigands, but he says that it was only to
get them in his power.”</p>

<p>“To hoodwink us, you mean,—why, such a
treaty is a positive crime!”</p>

<p>They all hung their heads, looking angry and
shamefaced as well as frightened, and Denis Saulsoy
said quickly, timidly, that it was not safe always
to speak out what one thought. Gangnot
was a man of few words, but he gave the anvil another
blow, and said, “Colas is right!”</p>

<p>“What are you afraid of, Denis?” said I. “You
are among friends,—do you think that walls have
ears? Here, Gangnot, go and stand in front of the
door with that hammer of yours, and knock the
head off the first man that tries to enter; he may
have ears to listen with, but I bet that he won’t
have a tongue to wag, after Gangnot has had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
good lick at him! Now is the time to decide;
speak up, if you are true men, for when we leave
here it will be to act, not to talk.”</p>

<p>This brought them all to their feet in a perfect
uproar; they broke out in a storm of rage against
Racquin, calling him a rascal, and Judas, and swearing
that he had sold us outright and all that we
possessed; but since he had the police behind him,
they were afraid to move or offer any resistance.</p>

<p>“Where is he to be found?” said I.</p>

<p>They told me, at the Town Hall, where he stayed
night and day, guarded by a troop of ragamuffins,
who were more like jailers than defenders.</p>

<p>“He is a prisoner then, in a word,” cried I.
“Gangnot, open that door! We will go at once
and set him free;—who is with me? It is too late
to hang back now!”</p>

<p>“Breugnon,” said Saulsoy, scratching his head,
“I do not mind a few hard knocks, but it is a different
matter to go against a man who represents
the law; if you resist the law, you are taking a
heavy——”</p>

<p>“Res-pon-si-bil-i-ty!” said I. “Well, why not?
My shoulders are broad enough to bear it, so none
of the rest of you need worry. When I see a
scoundrel I kill him first, and find out afterwards
if he is Pope or Procurator. When order has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
turned to chaos, it is time to take the law into our
own hands.”</p>

<p>This ended the discussion, and we all filed out
with Gangnot at our head, his hammer in his huge
four-fingered hand, (he had crushed one of them
on the anvil). He looked like a walking tower,
tall and strong, his face blackened by smoke, and
one eye squinting horribly, but we all crowded in
behind his broad back, and each man ran to his
house to get his weapons. I should not like to
swear that they all came back armed; perhaps some
of the poor fellows could not find their axes or their
arquebuses, for when we assembled in the market-place,
our ranks were rather thin, if the truth were
told; but those who did come were true as steel;
men you could put your trust in.</p>

<p>When we got to the Town Hall, we found by
great good luck that the main door was wide open;
perhaps because our kind shepherd was so sure that
his lambs would let themselves be shorn without
so much as a baa-a, that he and his watch-dogs,
having partaken of a hearty dinner, were all
wrapped in slumber. Under these circumstances
our assault was by no means heroic; we just walked
in, and caught, as they say, the bird on her nest.</p>

<p>Racquin was dragged out of his bed, just as he
was, like a skinned rabbit; and he looked anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
but pretty, with rolls of fat all over his pink body,
even on his forehead and round his eyes. We soon
found that he knew what we were after, and was
equal to the situation. He flashed an angry glare
at us out of his sharp gray eyes, under their puffy
eyelids; but he controlled himself at once, and with
an authoritative air, inquired by what right we
thus invaded the precincts of the law. I answered
that we only wanted to drag him out of bed. This
made him furiously angry, but Saulsoy said to him,
“Master Racquin, you are not the one to threaten
us; the boot is on the other leg now. We are here
to accuse you, so defend yourself if you can.”</p>

<p>He changed his tune at once. “Fellow-citizens,”
said he blandly, “what would you have of me?
What complaint do you bring? I have stayed in
the town to protect you at the risk of my own life,
when all my brother officials fled before the plague
and the riots. I alone have remained faithful at my
post. The evils which have come upon you are
surely none of my causing, so what fault can any
of you find with me?”</p>

<p>“You are the physician of the town, Racquin,”
said I, “and as the proverb says, ‘Clever doctors
make bad sores.’—You have fattened on the plague
and the riots, you and your creatures; you are in
league with the robbers to burn down our houses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
which you ought to protect; and instead of resisting
the mobs, you have made yourself a leader
among them. We do not know if you have thus
betrayed us through fear or greed, but you shall
choose yourself what label we are to hang about
your neck: ‘This is one who sold his town for
thirty pieces of silver.’ Prices are higher than they
were in Iscariot’s day, so I will put instead, ‘An
Alderman who saved his own skin at the expense
of his fellow-citizens.’”</p>

<p>“Breugnon,” said he, with an ugly look, “I have
only done my duty in burning infected dwellings
according to law.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and when a man is not one of your adherents
you mark his house with a cross, and call
it infected. And how about letting the mob in to
pillage? That is a good way to stop the spread
of the plague, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I was unable to prevent it, in all cases, and besides,
if these ruffians catch the pest while they are
looting the houses, so much the better, we are rid
of two nuisances at once.”</p>

<p>“A splendid idea. The robbers kill the plague,
and the plague kills the robbers, and the Alderman
inherits what remains of the town! It is as I said
just now, the clever doctor survives both disease
and patient. Now I tell you what it is, Master<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
Racquin, your treatment is too high-priced for us.
We will take care of ourselves from this time onward,
and by way of salary for former services, we
will give you——”</p>

<p>“Six feet of ground in the nearest graveyard,”
Gangnot finished the sentence for me, and at the
word our followers sprang forward like a pack of
wolves. I threw myself before their prey, while
he took refuge between the bed and the wall, staring
wildly out at their furious faces. He was such
a miserable object, shivering there like a fat pig,
without a rag to cover him that, just out of pity, I
told him to get his clothes on.</p>

<p>“We have seen enough of your hide, for one
while, my friend,” said I. This made the others
laugh, and seeing them in a better humor, I began
to try to make them hear reason. Racquin meanwhile
hurried on his clothes, his teeth chattering
with cold, and an evil gleam in his eye. He knew
that the danger was over for the moment; that for
a day at least his life was reasonably safe, so when
he was fully dressed, he plucked up his courage
and went so far as to call us all rebels; threatening
to punish us for insulting a magistrate.</p>

<p>“You are no longer Magistrate,” said I. “You
are dismissed by my order!”</p>

<p>At this he turned on me; forgetting all prudence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
and screaming with rage, he cried out that he knew
me for a rascally trouble-maker; that I had stirred
up the others to attack him, and that on me should
fall the most condign punishment.</p>

<p>“Shall I kill him?” said Gangnot, balancing his
hammer. I held him back as I answered:</p>

<p>“It is lucky for you, Racquin, that I have been
ruined, for you know well enough that, if I hanged
you now, people would say it was out of revenge
for the fire. A halter would just suit your style
of beauty, and one of these days you will certainly
wear one round that fat neck of yours. But the
thing is that we have got you now, and are going
to strip your Alderman’s gown from your back; we
are the Government here until further notice.”</p>

<p>“You are taking your life in your hand, Breugnon.”</p>

<p>“What if I am? I risk it for the good of the
town, and if I lose, Clamecy will be the winner!”</p>

<p>He was sent to prison forthwith, and to make
room for him we released an old sergeant whom
he had shut up three days before, for disobedience
of orders. The sheriff and all of the staff at the
Town Hall came round to our side, now that the
blow was struck, declaring that Racquin was a
traitor, and that they had always said so; (if they
had, it was in a very low whisper).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>Our plan had run as smoothly as if on wheels,
up to now; so much so that I was really surprised,
and asked, “Where on earth are the brigands?”
And just then a breathless messenger ran up to
warn us that the mob was outside the Lourdeaux
gate-tower, and that they were attacking Peter
Poullard’s warehouse in Béyant, burning, sacking,
and carrying all before them.</p>

<p>“This time,” said I, “they will have to dance to
our piping,” and we rushed down to the Mirandole
terrace, which overhangs the lower town. We
could see nothing but a dense cloud of smoke shot
through with red flames; above our heads sounded
the frantic tocsin from the tower of St. Martin’s,
while from below rose a perfectly infernal clamor.</p>

<p>“Comrades,” said I, “let us get down there as
quick as we can, for the oven is heating, and no
mistake,—but who is to lead us? You, Saulsoy?”</p>

<p>He hung back, however, saying that it was bad
enough to be out of his bed at midnight, with an
old musket in his hand, but when it came to making
him Captain, that was a little too much! He
did not mind obeying, he said, but for a fellow who
had never been able to decide anything in his life,
it was ridiculous to ask him to give orders.</p>

<p>“Who will be chief, then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>No one stirred; I was ready to dance with impatience,
but such people are all alike, willing enough
to follow, but when it comes to taking the lead, no
one at home! They were all cautious householders,
and with them the habit of hesitation is so inveterate
that they will spend half a day bargaining
over the sheet they want to buy, and fingering the
linen until, perhaps, the chance is gone.</p>

<p>“If no one else offers, I will be captain!” cried
I. “But first understand one thing: for this night
I give orders and you obey them; no talking, no
hanging back, for if we fail now we are all lost; so
remember I am to be master. It will be time
enough to judge me tomorrow. What do you
say?”</p>

<p>“Agreed!” they shouted with one voice, and we
started down the hill. I went first, Gangnot at my
left, and Bardet, the town crier, on my right with
his drum. Down by the gate leading to the suburbs,
we found a crowd of people, men, women, and
children, streaming out toward the place where
looting was going on, as if it were a fair. They
were all in a very good humor, and some of the
housewives were carrying baskets as they do on a
market day. They moved politely aside to let us
pass, not knowing who we were, and then fell into
step, and marched on behind us. Among them was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
a man I knew, Perruche, the barber. He was carrying
a paper lantern in his hand, and as I came near,
he held it up to my face, and as soon as he saw who
it was he called out, “Hullo, Colas! Glad to see
you back! Come and have a drink.”</p>

<p>“Tomorrow if you like,” said I. “There is a
time for everything.”</p>

<p>“You must be breaking up, Breugnon. Thirst
is always in season, and if we wait till tomorrow
all the good wine may be gone. Is it possible that
you have actually lost your taste for a good September
vintage?”</p>

<p>“Stolen drink has no flavor.”</p>

<p>“Stolen? You mean saved out of a burning
house. I should be a pretty fool to let it all run
away into the gutter.”</p>

<p>“Thief!” said I, and pushed him out of my way,
and as each man behind came up, he too said,
“Thief,” and frowned at the barber, who stood
completely dumfounded for a moment. Then we
heard him shouting, and as I looked over my
shoulder I saw that he was running after us, shaking
his fist. But as nobody took any more notice
of him, he fell silent when he had caught up to us,
and marched on behind.</p>

<p>The crowd was so dense when we came to the
waterside, just by the first Yonne bridge, that I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
halted and ordered the drum to beat; this made
them open a little, so that we pushed forward like
a wedge; but after a few yards we could go no further.
I found myself rubbing elbows with two
boatmen whom I knew well; one Father Joachim,
nicknamed “Calabre,” and the other a man named
Gadin, called Gueurlu.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here, Master Breugnon,”
said one, “all harnessed up like a prize donkey?
Are you out for fun or a fight?”</p>

<p>“There’s many a true word spoken in jest,
Calabre. I have just been appointed Captain of
Clamecy, and I am here to defend the town against
all its enemies.”</p>

<p>“There are no enemies that I know of,” said
he. “You must be cracked.”</p>

<p>“What do you call that crowd down there, setting
fire to houses?”</p>

<p>“We are all sorry that your house was burnt the
first day, Master,” said he, “but now that it is gone,
I don’t see what difference it makes to you if we do
go for a fat old thief like Poullard, who grows rich
on the wool that he pulls off our backs, and then
turns up his nose at us. It is a good deed to rob
the likes of him, and anyhow you are in the same
boat with us poor men now, all to gain and nothing
to lose, so get out of our way!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>I hated to get my hands on these poor devils, so
I tried to make them hear reason first.</p>

<p>“You have everything to lose, Calabre,” I said;
“your honor to begin with.”</p>

<p>“Honor!” cried he. “Is it good to eat?
What’s the use of talking about a thing like that,
when you know we may soon be all dead men;
dead and blown away as if we had never existed?”</p>

<p>“Honor, indeed!” said Gueurlu; “that’s a word
they put on rich men’s tombstones, but when we
die, they shovel us into the common ditch. Can you
tell by the smell if we had honor or not?”</p>

<p>“Joachim,” said I, turning away from Gueurlu,
“it is true a man does not amount to much all by
himself, but get a lot of men together and it’s a
different story; many a little makes a mickle, you
know, and when the rich are all swept away and
forgotten, with their lying epitaphs, down to the
very names they are so proud of, then the hard-working
people of Clamecy will be known as her
real nobility. We must not have it said that we too
were rascals.”</p>

<p>“Much I care!” said Gueurlu, but Calabre cried,
“You are a pig-face! You care for nothing, but I
am like Breugnon,—I do care what they say of me,
and by St. Nicholas! the rich shall not have all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
honor to themselves; high or low, there is not one
of them worth our little fingers!”</p>

<p>This brought on a great dispute. Gueurlu persisted
that our betters from the least to the greatest,
from our own Duke up to the princes, did
nothing but grab, and stuff their bellies with other
folks’ dinners; and even laid hands on the King’s
treasures as soon as the breath was out of his
body;—that there was no use in talking about
“honor” after that;—we might as well take a leaf
out of their book.</p>

<p>Calabre said they were indeed a set of hogs, and
that some day our Henry would come back from
the tomb to make them disgorge, or else we would
all rise ourselves, and cut their throats for them.
But meanwhile, we were going to show them that
there was more real honor in us than in the heart
of what they call a nobleman.</p>

<p>“Hooray!” cried I; “you are with us then?”</p>

<p>“Yes, by the Mother of God! And Gueurlu is
coming too.”</p>

<p>“No, he isn’t!”</p>

<p>“I tell you he is, or I’ll pitch him neck and crop
into the river! Here we go, forward march! Out
of my road, Wrigglers!”</p>

<p>He forced his way through the press, and we
followed like a school of herrings. Most of the men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
we came up against now were so far gone in drink
that there was no use in saying a word to them;
anyhow, there is a time for everything, and we had
got past the talking stage; there was nothing left
to us but our fists; so as drunken men are safe
all the world over, we just sat them down on the
stones as gently as we could and went on.</p>

<p>By this time we had reached the warehouse
gates, and could see the looters swarming all over
Master Pierre Poullard’s house like ants. Some
were ripping open chests and bales, bedizening
themselves in stolen finery; others, with shrieks of
laughter, were throwing everything breakable they
could find out of the windows. The courtyard was
full of wine barrels and frantic drinkers. I saw one
man with his mouth to the bunghole, who having
drunk till he could hold no more, rolled over on
his back, the red stream still spattering in his face,
and running away into little pools on the ground,
where children were lapping up the wine, and mud
with it.</p>

<p>The rioters had heaped up a great pile of furniture
in a corner of the court, and had set it on
fire so that they might see the better. But the
whole infernal orgy centered in the cellars, where
from all directions came the sound of mallets, as
great barrels and tuns were staved in, and the wine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
poured out in floods. Groans, screams, and choking
coughs echoed from the low arches, as if a herd
of swine had been let loose there, and already long
tongues of flame and smoke came licking out of the
bars of the windows. They were all so busy, each
man intent on what he was doing, that no one
seemed to see us as we made our way into the
yard. I signed to Bardet,—he beat a long roll on
his drum, and then in a voice of thunder announced
my appointment as Captain. The instant he ceased
I took up the word, and ordered the mob to disperse
on pain of severe penalties.</p>

<p>At the first tap of the drum they had all drawn
together like a swarm of bees, buzzing angrily;
then shrieking, and hurling stones, they rushed
upon us. After a fierce struggle we pushed them
back, and succeeded in forcing the doors of the
cellar under a hail of tiles and billets of wood from
the upper windows, in spite of which we made our
entrance good, and then had time to breathe and
count our wounded.</p>

<p>Poor old Gangnot had lost another finger, and
Calabre’s right eye was badly injured; for me,
I had caught my thumb in the hinge of the door-flap,
as I banged it shut; and by my faith, it turned
me sick and faint like a woman. Fortunately there
was an open keg of brandy close at hand, and after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
I had swallowed a dram and bathed my thumb in
some of the same, my head ceased to go round; but
as the fight went on, the pain made me as mad as
a tiger.</p>

<p>By this time we were inside, and all struggling
together on the stairs leading from the house to
the cellar, and I felt that we could not keep this up
long, as these devils were discharging their muskets,
close into our very faces, so that they set Saulsoy’s
beard on fire, and Gueurlu had to squeeze it
out between his hard hands. Luckily the rioters
were too drunk to shoot straight, or we none of us
would have come out of it alive. I could see also
that we had an ally in the fire, which was creeping
round the court from wing to wing, toward the main
building where we were; so when we had retreated
to the topmost step, some of us stood firm, while
the rest hastily raised a barrier of loose stones and
rubbish, reaching to the lintel of the doorway.
Through the chinks we stuck our pikes and lances,
like the quills of a porcupine. “Now,” cried I,
“those who like fire, will soon have plenty of it!”</p>

<p>The cellars were full of men, for the most part
too drunk to realize their danger; but when the
flames appeared through the cracks of the walls and
began to eat away the beams of the roof, it was a
perfect pandemonium of yells and curses, and like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
bubbling wine in a vat they rose to the surface,
and made a rush for our staircase. Some of the
foremost, with their clothes actually on fire, were
crushed against our barricade by the weight of
those behind them, and their bodies filled the doorway
from side to side, like a cork in a bottle. It was
horrible to see; and also to hear the fire raging and
roaring! If I had been just then the simple Breugnon
of everyday life, I should have tried to save
the poor screaming wretches, but when a man is in
authority, he must think of nothing outside of his
duty; compassion at that crisis would have been
sheer weakness. I knew that the safety of the city
hung on the defeat of these brigands, for if they
had escaped they would have outnumbered our
small forces, and with the fear of the gallows before
their eyes, would have fought to desperation.
No, there was now nothing for it but to smoke the
wasps out of their nest.</p>

<p>Just at this moment whom should I see over the
heads of the crowd but my old schoolfellow, Gambi!
He was a good-for-nothing soaker, it is true, and
had no business to be where he was, but we had
been playmates from childhood, had been confirmed
on the same day together, and I could not
bear to leave an old chum to such a fate.</p>

<p>I crawled between our pikes over the barrier,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
and somehow forced apart the tightly wedged mass
of human beings, though it seemed as if there was
not room to move more than your eyelids. Gambi
was tottering on the edge of the lowest step, held
up by those around him, and I reached him literally
walking on the bodies of the others, who snapped
and tore at me in passing, so that I thought that I
should have to bring him away in pieces. But
there is a special Providence for drunkards,—for
some of them at least,—and at last I was able to
seize him by the collar, and fighting and kicking out
right and left, I dragged him to the floor where the
air was clearer.</p>

<p>There was little time to spare! The fire was
roaring through the doorway, as if up a chimney,
driving out men from the rampart we had made,
and I could smell the roasting flesh of the brigands
on the staircase. Stooping low and treading on I
knew not what, I dragged Gambi by his hair
through a hole in the wall, and somehow managed
to reach the outside of the warehouse, leaving the
fire to finish the work of destruction. When my
men rejoined me they were so glad to see me safe
that they could not do enough for Gambi; and after
we had revived and fed him, we found under his
rags some beautiful colored enamels, which he had
stolen, God knows where! and contrived to hold on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
to during all the struggle. He was of course completely
sobered by this time, and weeping with
gratitude he pulled out his ill-gotten treasures, and
threw them away with all his strength, declaring
that stolen goods would never prosper and that he
could not bear to keep them!</p>

<p>At sunrise the next morning Robinet appeared,
triumphantly leading the Procurator, a force of
thirty men at arms, and a large party of peasants.
Later came the Magistrate with more reinforcements,
and the next day our good Duke sent in
some of his own followers. Order being now restored,
they set to work. First they raked among
the hot cinders, then they drew up a list of property
destroyed, added their own pay and expenses, and
returned whence they came,—except, of course, our
own officials, who remained with us.</p>

<p>What then was the moral of all this experience?
It is this,—help yourself, and others will help you.</p>

<small>A PRACTICAL JOKE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="right">September 30th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Order</span> being re-established, and the ashes cooled,
we heard no more talk of the plague and the riots,
but for all that the city seemed crushed, and its
inhabitants, still hardly recovered from their
fright, appeared to feel their way; as if they did not
know who was to have the upper hand in future.</p>

<p>For the most part men kept indoors, but if
obliged to go out, they crept close along by the
house walls, like a dog with his tail between his
legs. The truth is, few had reason to be proud of
their part in the late troubles, and a man hardly
liked to look at his own face in the glass, for there
he saw human nature, stripped of all disguises:—not
a pretty sight, and one that makes most of us
feel shamefaced and suspicious.</p>

<p>I too was uneasy and sad, but for different reasons:
first, I was haunted by the thought of the
massacre in the burning cellars; and on the other
hand, when I looked in the familiar faces of my
neighbors, I could not help remembering their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
cruelty and cowardice: this made bad feeling between
us, for they knew, of course, how I felt. I
longed to wipe it all out, and behave as if nothing
had happened, but as that could not be, we all
went about in the altered town, under the heat
and languor of late summer.</p>

<p>Racquin had been sent to Nevers for trial; but
it was a question whether he fell under the jurisdiction
of the Duke or the King, so he stood a fair
chance of getting off scot free. Our county authorities
were kind enough to overlook my illegal
conduct;—for it seems that in saving Clamecy that
night, I had committed half a dozen crimes, any
one of which would have been enough to bring me
to the galleys;—but as none of this could have
happened if they themselves had remained at the
post of duty, they decided to pass it over in silence;
a decision in which I naturally acquiesced. The
less I have to do with courts of justice the better,
I always think; for you never know how a trial will
turn out, and innocence itself is no real protection.
If you once get your little finger into the cursed
machinery of the law, you are like to lose the whole
arm, and you may have to cut that off to save your
body: so between their lordships and myself there
was a tacit agreement that they had seen nothing
out of the way while I was Captain of Clamecy:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
because everything on that fateful night had been
accomplished by themselves alone.</p>

<p>It is much easier, however, to shut one’s eyes
to the past than to rub it off the slate: there is
such a thing as memory, and, when we met face to
face, it was awkward for both parties. I could see
that they had a lurking dread of me, and to tell the
truth I was rather afraid myself of this absurd unknown
Breugnon, who had suddenly sprung up and
performed such exploits. I had never supposed
myself to be an Attila or a Cæsar; my eloquence
had hitherto been inspired by wine rather than by
war;—and in short on both sides we were shamefaced
and out of sorts in mind and body. There is
no remedy like hard work, and as the riots had provided
plenty to do for every one in the town, we all
went at it with the utmost energy. The ruins had
to be cleared away first; then by good luck the harvest
that year was unusually abundant, both in
grain and fruit; and as for the vintage, the oldest
inhabitant could remember nothing to equal it.</p>

<p>Our good Mother Earth seemed to have drunk
so much of our blood, only that she might restore
it to us in generous wine: for nothing in this world
is really wasted or lost; everything has to go somewhere.
If the rain falls from the clouds and is
drawn up to them again, then why should not the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
blood in our veins go and come between us and
the earth? I have always loved to think that in
some former existence I was a vigorous vine-root,
and shall be one again perhaps, during a delightful
immortality. How good it would be to grow and
flourish, to feel my dark velvety bunches of grapes
swell and fill with sweet juices, under the warm
sunshine: and it must be best of all to be eaten!
Setting such speculations aside, the earth bled at
every pore during this wonderful season, so that
we did not know what to do with the juice of our
vines. As there were not casks enough to go
round, masses of grapes were heaped up in vats,
without even pressing them. Father Coullemard,
an old man who lived at Andries, could not dispose
of his crop, and so offered his grapes at the vineyard,
for thirty sous a barrel.</p>

<p>Imagine our feelings! In our part of the world
we cannot bear to throw anything away; so, as
there was nothing for it but to drink the wine on
the spot, we all did our duty like men. The labors
of Hercules were nothing to it, but I am afraid
that the hero himself, and not Antæus, fell and
touched Mother Earth!</p>

<p>Everybody felt cheerful and more like himself
when this was over, but still there was something
unpleasant,—a sort of constraint among us, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
even in the midst of our carouses there was altogether
too much solitary drinking,—in my opinion
an evil and unhealthy practice. How long this sort
of thing would have lasted, I cannot undertake to
say, but chance intervened, and once more brought
us all together. Love can unite <i>two</i> hearts, but
the only thing that can make a large number of
men act as one, is the fear of a common enemy; and
in our case, this enemy was our master. Duke
Charles of Nevers took it into his head this year to
forbid our games and dances, and as a natural consequence,
every one who was not crippled with
gout, and who could put foot to the ground, was
seized with a perfect passion for dancing.</p>

<p>No one exactly understood why, but the bone of
contention between the Duke and the town had always
been the Count’s Meadows, which lie outside
the gates, at the foot of Picon Hill, watered by the
Beuvron, which winds through them like a silver
serpent. For more years than any one can remember,
there had been a dispute about these meadows:
pull devil, pull baker, and it was a question which
had got the best of it. Of course the contest was
conducted with the utmost politeness on both
sides;—“My friends of the good town of Clamecy,”
and “Your Lordship’s most obedient”;—but
neither party would yield an inch, for all that.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
When we had resort to the courts, we always got
the worst of it; the judgment rendered being invariably
that our meadows did not belong to us;
but this did not bother us in the least, as we had
reason to know that justice can make black seem
white—at a price.</p>

<p>Possession, however, is nine points of the law, so
we just held on to our playground, which had special
advantages, because it was the only bit of land
which was not the private property of some one in
the town, and therefore might be said to belong to
us all; or perhaps to the Duke, which came to
much the same thing. Being common property,
we did not mind spoiling it, and anything that was
not convenient to do on our own premises, we did
on the Count’s Meadows. We washed clothes,
carded wool, and beat carpets; there was a large
rubbish heap there, and many goats led out to
pasture. On fine days we played games, or danced
to a hurdy-gurdy; we shot at a target, and practised
the drum and trumpet, and at night there
were any number of loving couples along the banks
of the Beuvron, which took it all as a matter of
course, though he saw enough to frighten most
rivers.</p>

<p>All went well as long as our old Duke Louis
lived, for he shut his eyes to our goings on, being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
a man of sense who knew that you must not keep
too tight a hand on the reins; he let us prance
about and play the fool a little, knowing all the
while that he was the master. His son, on the contrary,
has the kind of conceit that prefers the
show of power to the reality, and likes to mount
his high horse on slight provocation. He ought to
have known that a Frenchman will always sing
and make fun of his rulers, and if that is not allowed,
he rebels; for he cannot bear people who
insist on being taken seriously, and loves those he
can laugh at, or with, for laughter puts all men on
a level.</p>

<p>The Duke, then, issued an order forbidding us to
play, dance, dig, walk on the grass, or trespass in
any way on the Count’s Meadows: and a good time
he chose for this piece of foolishness, just after all
our misfortunes, when instead of annoying us, he
ought at the very least to have remitted some of
our taxes. He soon found, however, that the Clamecyans
are not made of soft fiber, but are tough
as old oaks, so that if you drive in a wedge you
have hard work to get it out again. There was no
need to call a meeting to protest against the edict;
from all sides arose a deafening clamor:—“What,
take away our meadows? The ground that he had
given us! (or that we had taken, it is all the same!)—land<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
that we stole four hundred years ago, which
has been doubly sacred to us ever since?—all the
dearer that we have been obliged to struggle for it
day by day, and inch by inch; holding on to it by
sheer tenacity! It was enough to discourage a
man from ever taking what did not belong to him;
enough really to make him sick of living! Our
dead would turn in their graves if we were weak
enough to yield on a point thus involving the honor
of the city. The fatal order was proclaimed with
beat of drum, by the town crier, who looked as if
he were going to execution; and that very evening,
there was a meeting held of all the men of importance
in the city; the heads of guilds, the chiefs of
brotherhoods and corporations, and those who
represented the various districts, came together
under the arches of the market. I was there, for
St. Anne’s, and, as you may suppose, there were
different opinions among the delegates as to what
ought to be done.”</p>

<p>Gangnot, in the name of St. Eloi, and Calabre, for
St. Nicholas, advocated strong measures; they
wanted to set fire to the fences round the fields,
break down the gates, knock the sergeants on the
head, and rip up the meadows from end to end. On
the other side, were Florimond, the baker, for St.
Honoré, and Maclou, the gardener, for St. Fiacre;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
they advised a more diplomatic course, a war of
words, and parchments, a petition to the Duchess,
accompanied, perhaps, by some cakes and some garden
stuff. Fortunately three of us, Jean Bobin for
St. Crispin, Émond Poifu for St. Vincent, and I,
were not disposed either to grovel before the Duke,
or to kick his head off. Keep in the middle of the
road, was our motto. In our part of the world we
like to get the better of people without too much
fuss and expense: it is all very well to revenge
yourself, but why not have a little fun out of it at
the same time? We hit at last upon a splendid idea—but
I am not going to tell you now what it was,
for that would spoil the joke. I will only say to
the credit of all of us, that for a whole fortnight
the great secret was kept perfectly, though it was
known to the entire town. The honor of first having
thought of it belongs to me, but they all added
something, here a touch and there another, till
there was nothing lacking. The Mayor and Aldermen
kept themselves informed of our progress, in
the discreetest manner; and Master Delavau, the
notary, would come slinking in every evening with
his cloak drawn up around his face, to show us how
to creep through the meshes of the law, while appearing
to respect it; and would draw up long
Latin addresses to the Duke, expressed in the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
submissive terms on the part of his contumacious
vassals. When the great day arrived, the town
guilds and companies with their masters assembled
at St. Martin’s Place, all dressed in their best,
and drawn up around their banners.</p>

<p>As ten strokes sounded from the great tower,
the bells began to ring, and on both sides of the
square the doors of St. Martin’s and of the Town
Hall were thrown open. From the church issued
the long procession of white-robed clergy, and on
the steps of the Town Hall appeared the green and
yellow gowns of the Mayor and aldermen. These
dignified bodies exchanged profound bows over
the heads of us, who stood below them; and then
they marched slowly down; first the beadles, with
their red cloaks and redder noses, and then the
town bailiffs, adorned with their gold chains of
office, and striking their staves loudly on the pavement
as they advanced.</p>

<p>We formed a great ring around the square, with
our backs to the houses; and the authorities placed
themselves just in the middle.</p>

<p>The whole town was there to the last man; the
pettifoggers and barristers were ranged under the
banner of St. Ives, (the man of business of Our
Father,) while the apothecaries, leeches and mediciners,
men of St. Cosmo, formed a guard of honor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
around the Mayor and the old Archdeacon. The
only absentee was the Procurator: he was indeed
the Duke’s representative, but he had married an
alderman’s daughter, and his interests being thus
divided, he did not want to be forced to take part
with one side or the other, and so found means
to keep out of the way.</p>

<p>We all waited there for a little while; the square
seething with noise and laughter, like a vat in ferment.
Every one talked at once, fiddles squeaked,
and dogs barked: what were we waiting for?
Something is coming, a surprise! and before we
could see anything we heard shouts drawing nearer,
and all heads turned at once, like weathercocks
when the wind changes. A procession now advanced
from the end of Market Street, and at its
head, borne on the shoulders of eight stout porters,
was a pyramid-shaped structure, looking like three
tables placed one above the other. The legs were
all wreathed with bright silks and flowers, and
from the highest hung long streamers of colored
ribbon, cords and tassels; on the top
was an ornamented dais supporting a veiled
statue.</p>

<p>As we were all in the secret, no one expressed
surprise, and though bursting with laughter, we
took off our hats and bowed deeply. When the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
platform reached the center of the square, it made
a stop between the Mayor and the vicar, and then
all the corporations and districts, each preceded
by its players, made one turn about the square,
and wheeling round the corner of the church, entered
the little street which goes down to the Beuvron
gate. St. Nicholas came first, as of right, with
Calabre leading, strutting along dressed in a church
cope, and glittering like a beetle with gold embroidery.
He carried the device of the river saint, a
boat in which were three little children, and was escorted
by four boatmen, bearing enormous yellow
candles as big as a man’s leg, and as hard as bricks;
ready for any emergency. Then came St. Eloi,
with his copper-workers, locksmiths and blacksmiths;
poor Gangnot, with the fingers that were
left to him, holding a cross engraved with the
badge of a hammer and anvil. Next, barrel-makers,
vintagers, and vinegrowers marched after their St.
Vincent, with a jug in one hand, and a bunch of
grapes in the other. St. Joseph and St. Anne followed,
mother and son-in-law, with the carpenters
and wood-carvers, and then St. Honoré, covered
with flour. He bore a sort of Roman trophy in his
hand, like a lance thrust through a round loaf with
a crown above it. After him were the cobblers
and leather-dressers, under St. Crispin;—last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
and best of all, came the gardeners, men and
women, carrying carnations and roses, their
spades and rakes all twined with flowers; their
fine red silk banner streaming in the wind
showed St. Fiacre, bare-legged, digging up the
ground.</p>

<p>After all these, the veiled platform moved on majestically.
Before it went girls in white, chanting
and scattering flowers: the Mayor and his staff
marched solemnly on either side, holding the ends
of the long streamers which hung from the dais,
while the guilds of St. Ives and St. Cosmo formed
an imposing escort. Then came the verger of St.
Martin’s, strutting like a game-cock, preceding two
priests, one long and thin, the other short and fat;
and the vicar himself, his hands folded over his
portly stomach, singing litanies in his deep bass
voice as he walked; or rather giving out a booming
note from time to time, while the others did the
work.</p>

<p>The general public brought up the rear in a miscellaneous
mass, like a flood held back, as it were,
by our procession. In this order we advanced
through the city gate, straight towards the Count’s
Meadows, in the midst of a whirl of golden plane
leaves, stripped from the trees by the wind and
sent fluttering before us into the sluggish river, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
which they drifted like flakes of gold. At the entrance
to the Meadows there was a guard of three
policemen and a Captain, in command at the château.
The latter was a new broom, and being eager
to magnify his office, he rolled his eyes and frowned
severely at us; but his own men and the citizens
understood one another, and they only opposed us
for form’s sake. We, on our side, made believe to
be offended, and demanded a passage with much
noise and profanity, but we had hard work to keep
our faces straight, and besides it would have been
risky to go on in this way much longer, for Calabre
and his men, getting out of hand, began to brandish
their big candles about the ears of the police. So
the Mayor stepped forward, raised his cap at arm’s
length from his head, and cried: “Hats off!” At
the word, the veil which hid the statue fell to
the ground, and the town bailiffs with loud voices
proclaimed: “Place for his Lordship the Duke!”
Instantly the tumult ceased, the saints and their
followers ranged themselves on both sides of the
way, and respectfully presented arms; while the
Captain and his satellites, hastily pulling off their
hats, stood aside to make way for the platform, on
which was perched the Duke in effigy. He wobbled
slightly, as his porters bore him along, but by
the plumed hat, sword, and wreath of laurels, it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
easy to recognize him; and to put the matter beyond
doubt, there was a pompous Latin inscription
at the base of the dais, proclaiming his dignity to
all the world.</p>

<p>The features were perhaps not a perfect likeness,
but as we had not had the time to make a new
statue we had just taken an old wooden figure,
which we found stuck away in the garret of the
Town Hall. We did not know who or what it represented,
but on the pedestal was the half-effaced
name of Balthazar, which we afterward shortened
to Balduke. No one cared whether the statue resembled
the Duke or not; statues seldom do look
like the people that they are supposed to represent;
witness those of the saints, or our Lord Himself;
but to the eye of faith they are perfectly satisfactory,
and as a devout believer sees his god in a
log of wood, just so that day we saw our Duke
before us.</p>

<p>All obstacles being removed, his Lordship
proudly entered his own meadows, and we naturally
followed; banners waving, drums beating,
trumpets sounding, and the Holy Sacrament as a
fitting climax. No loyal subject would have dared
to offer any objection, so even the sulky Captain
was obliged to choose between stopping the Duke
or following him, and he decided to fall into step<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
with us. And now, with victory in sight, we very
nearly came to grief at the eleventh hour; for a dispute
arose as to who should pass in first, and all
considerations due to age or sex were completely
forgotten. St. Eloi and St. Nicholas jostled one another,
St. Joseph was rude to his mother-in-law:
and as we were all somewhat over-excited, the consequences
might have been serious. Fortunately I
was able to intervene with success; having a foot
in every camp. My name is Nicholas, my trade is
under the protection of Sts. Joseph and Anne, and
the patron of vineyards, St. Vincent, may be called
my foster brother, as he and I have sucked at the
same breast; so I belong to all the saints, if only
they are on my side.</p>

<p>Just then I happened to spy a country cart passing,
and who should be lurching along beside it but
my friend Gambi? “Comrades!” I cried, “we
must not try to get ahead of each other on this
glorious day; the greatest among us is here;—after
the Duke, of course! so give three cheers for
Bacchus!” Whereupon I caught Gambi by the
slack of his breeches and threw him up into the
cart, where he alighted in a cask of grapes; then
seizing the reins, we drove in triumphantly; first
Bacchus sitting in his cask, kicking his legs and
laughing fit to kill himself; and then all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
procession following arm in arm, dancing with
joy.</p>

<p>It was delightful to be once more in our dear
Meadows; and there we stayed all day, and far into
the night, cooking, eating, and playing around the
statue of the good Duke.</p>

<p>The place looked like a pigsty the next day;
there was not a single blade of grass left, and the
print of our feet was stamped deep all over the
ground, as a proof of the devotion with which his
loyal subjects had feasted their suzerain. He must
have been hard to please if he was not satisfied, and
we on our part were delighted with the events of
the day.</p>

<p>An inquiry was indeed started by the Procurator,
who professed to be indignant, and threatened us
with dire consequences; but on second thoughts he
found it wiser to let the whole thing drop; since no
one really wanted to close the door so happily reopened.</p>

<p>This was the method we chose to show that we
could be true subjects of the Duke and King, and
yet insist on having our own way—for there is
no denying that we are a stiff-necked generation—and
this being done, the town seemed to pick up
its spirits after the trials it had passed through,
and we were once more all good friends together.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
We would wink and slap each other on the back,
when we met, and say that people had better let
us alone, as the good tricks were not yet all out
of the bag: and so in this way the memory of our
misfortunes died away and was forgotten.</p>

<small>OTHER PEOPLE’S HOUSES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="right">October.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> much delay I was finally obliged to settle
down somewhere; I kept putting it off on the
pretense that I wanted to look carefully over the
ground, but I had to come to it at last, much
against my will. At first the whole town was
open to me, and my friends were eager to offer
me a bed for a night or two; every one naturally
pitied a man whose hearth was a heap of cold
cinders, and wanted to give him what help they
could; “at first” I say, but as the recollection of
our disasters faded away, people began once more
to draw back into their shells,—except poor victims
like me who had no shells left to draw into.</p>

<p>My children would have been shocked at the
bare idea of my living at the inn; such a thing was
never heard of among good Clamecyans of our
sort, and, though it was not exactly a matter of
feeling with my sons, there was the terrible question
to be considered—“What would people say?”
There was no hurry, of course, on their part or on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
mine; we both tried to put off the evil day, for I
am altogether too outspoken to be at my ease in
bigoted households such as theirs, so we dodged
around the question in a most uncomfortable state
of mutual embarrassment.</p>

<p>Martine got us out of our dilemma by insisting
that I must come to her, for she really does love
and want me;—but there was my son-in-law.
Naturally there was no reason why he should wish
to have me as a permanent member of his household,
and so there we all were! This made me feel
as if my poor old bones were being put up for
sale, and I kept out of their way as much as possible,
while on their side they watched me with
a suspicious eye.</p>

<p>I took refuge for a short time on the slopes of
Beaumont in that little hut where I had been so
sick with the plague in July; for the joke of it was
that though the mob had burned my healthy house
they left standing the worthless shed where Death
and I had slept together, and now that he had
no more terrors for me it was really a pleasure
to go back to the poor little place with its trampled
floor, still littered with the empty bottles of my
somewhat funereal orgy.</p>

<p>The place was uninhabitable in winter, as I knew
well enough; the door was half off its hinges, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
window panes cracked, and the roof leaked like a
sieve; but tomorrow can take care of the things of
itself, and today, at least, there was no prospect
of rain, so I put off all thought of the future till
the week after next. “It will be time enough to
cross the bridge when I come to it,” thought I,
“and perhaps the world will come to an end between
now and then. I should be vexed enough
if I heard the Angel Gabriel blowing his horn just
after I had swallowed such a bitter pill; no, I like
to drink my pleasure fresh out of the barrel, but
disagreeable things can always stand till they get
stale.”</p>

<p>Well, there I waited, holding my troubles at
arm’s length, but I did not give myself up exclusively
to meditation. Behind my locked gates, I
dug in my garden, covered up all the roots snugly
against the winter, raked away the fallen leaves
from the paths, and, generally, made the place tidy;
then there was a little tree on which still hung a
few red and yellow pears, and my delight was to
lie on the sunny bank and let the sweet juice slip
gently down my throat.</p>

<p>I only went to town when it was absolutely
necessary to replenish my store of provisions and
news, and when I was there I carefully avoided
my sons, having given out that I had gone on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
journey. They may not have thought this story
literally true, but it would have been disrespectful
to contradict a report started by their father, so we
kept on playing our little game of hide-and-go-seek
until Martine upset it all.</p>

<p>We had not taken her sufficiently into our calculations,
and, like most of her sex, she had no
idea of playing fair, and being besides thoroughly
up to all my tricks, she found me without much
trouble. She is anyhow a great stickler for duty,
family feeling, and all that sort of thing. One evening
when I was working in the garden, I caught
sight of my daughter coming up the hill; I made
one jump into the house, and, locking the door, lay
down against the wall. In a minute or two I heard
her steps, and then she tried the door, shook it,
knocked, and called out to me; I lay there like a
dead leaf, holding my breath, though I had a tickling
in my throat and wanted dreadfully to cough.
(I don’t know why, but it always happens like
that.) It was not so easy to get rid of her, however;
she kept battering at the door and window,
and calling, “Father, let me in! I know you
are there; let me in!”</p>

<p>“What a minx it is!” I said to myself. “I
should have no chance at all if that door gave
way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>I had half a mind to open it myself and give
her a good hug, but I hate to yield about anything,
so I lay still and after a little while she got
tired and stopped her pounding; then I could hear
her walking slowly down the path. I came out
of my corner and began to laugh, and cough and
laugh again till I was nearly choking, and when I
got over the fit, and stopped to wipe my eyes, I
heard a voice behind me saying, “You ought to
be ashamed of yourself!”</p>

<p>It nearly knocked me flat, but I turned my head
and there on top of the wall was Martine looking
at me.</p>

<p>“I’ve got you now, you old joker!” she cried.</p>

<p>“I’m caught, sure enough,” said I, and we both
laughed to our hearts’ content.</p>

<p>As soon as I had let her in she stood sternly before
me, then grabbed me by the beard. “Say
you’re sorry,” she cried.</p>

<p>You know how it is at confession; you repent,
meaning to do it again the next opportunity, so
I replied meekly, “<i>Mea culpa!</i>”</p>

<p>But she kept pulling me to and fro, declaring
that it was a disgrace for an old white-beard like
me to have no more sense than a baby; finally she
gave me a last pull and tap on the cheek, and threw
her arms round my neck saying, “Why didn’t you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
come to me, Father, when you know how much I
want you?”</p>

<p>“My dear little girl, I will explain all about it.”</p>

<p>“You can explain as we go along, you are coming
home with me this minute.”</p>

<p>“Martine, you must give me time to pack up
my things.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do your packing,” cried she, and with that
she threw an old cloak over my shoulders, jammed
my hat on my head, picked up my bundle, and told
me to come along. I sat down on the step and
said there was no hurry, which made her furiously
angry.</p>

<p>“Why do you object to coming to my house?”
said she.</p>

<p>“I don’t object, I know sooner or later I shall
have to do it.”</p>

<p>“That’s a pretty way to talk,” said she. “I
don’t believe you care anything about me!”</p>

<p>“You know very well how much I love you,
darling! but you are dearer to me in my own
house, than in an outsider’s!”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say I am an outsider?”</p>

<p>“You are half one, you see!”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort! I am just myself, as you
know perfectly well; his wife, of course, just as
he is my husband, and I go his way as long as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
goes mine, but you can set your mind at rest, he
will be perfectly charmed to have you in the house,
or else I will know the reason why!”</p>

<p>“I’ve had plenty of lodgers of that sort,” said I,
“when our Lord of Nevers billeted them on us, but
I had rather not be one my own self.”</p>

<p>“You will have to learn,” said she. “Come, I
am waiting.”</p>

<p>“Agreed; but on condition that you will take
me in on my own terms.”</p>

<p>“You are a perfect old tyrant! but there, I
promise!”</p>

<p>“On your honor?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, now that’s enough talking, I won’t
wait another minute,” and she seized my arm in
such a grip that I had to go willy-nilly.</p>

<p>When we got to her house, she showed me with
pride the room she had arranged for me behind
the shop, all warm and comfortable and directly
under her eye, as if I were a child of a year old.
I was touched to see how the dear girl had made
up the bed with her best linen sheets and comforter,
and had put a nosegay on the table; it
made me laugh too when I thought how furious
she would be. “This won’t do at all,” said I,
so though vexed enough she showed me the other
rooms downstairs, but I would have none of them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
and finally chose a little nook under the mansarded
roof.</p>

<p>In spite of everything she could say, I declared
that she might take it or leave it, that if she would
not let me have the room I liked, I would go back
to my hut, so she had to give in, but every day
and all day long she kept at me about it.</p>

<p>“That’s not a fit place for you, Father, the
other room is much more comfortable,—why in
the world don’t you like it?”</p>

<p>“Because I don’t,” I would say and then she
would go into a rage, and swear that I would drive
her crazy, that she knew why I behaved so, it was
just because I was too stuffy and proud to be beholden
to any of my children, even to her.</p>

<p>“I should like to box your ears!” she would
cry, and then I would tell her that would be the
only way to make me accept something from her
gratis.</p>

<p>“You don’t love me, Daddy.”</p>

<p>“Now, my little girl, my own sweet baby!”</p>

<p>“Let me alone! Don’t you dare to touch me!
You can’t make up to me like that, old fraud that
you are! And all the time you are just laughing
at me. I can see your mouth twitching.”</p>

<p>“You’re laughing yourself, Martine,” and I put
my finger on her cheek, which broke into a smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>“All the same, I am really angry,” said she,
“even if you do make me laugh with your nonsense,
but in my heart I think you are a horrid old
thing! You have lost your house and you are too
stuck-up to let your daughter help you; it is nothing
but wicked pride, and you have no right to
behave so!”</p>

<p>“It is the only right that is left to me,” said I.</p>

<p>But that did not end the matter and there was
never any lack of sharp words between two people
like us, who both of us had a fine edge to our
tongues; but, luckily, a joke could always make us
laugh in the midst of our discussions and so the
storm would blow over.</p>

<p>One evening when her tongue had been going
like a clapper, and I had long ceased to listen, I
told her at last it was time to stop, and wait for
the rest till the next day.</p>

<p>“Very well then,” she said. “Good-night! But
won’t you change your mind, old Peacock?”</p>

<p>“Listen, dear, I am proud as a peacock, if you
choose to say so, but, frankly now, in my place
what would you do?”</p>

<p>“Pretty much the same thing.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, you see! Now give me a kiss for
good-night.”</p>

<p>She did kiss me but I could hear her muttering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
to herself that it was hard luck for her to have two
such wooden heads in one family.</p>

<p>“Well, pound the other one as much as you
please, but leave me in peace.”</p>

<p>“He will get his share, never fear, and you
too,” she answered; and then the next day it began
all over again, so that I really thought on the whole
I had more than was due to me.</p>

<p>For the first few days I was in clover, and every
one petted and spoiled me; even Florimond, who
overwhelmed me with attentions greater than I desired
or deserved, for I saw that Martine was keeping
her eye on him. Glodie was always twittering
around me; I had the most comfortable chair; I
was helped first at table, and when I spoke every
one listened in respectful silence.</p>

<p>It was all perfectly delightful, but I felt that I
could not stand much more; it made me restless,
and I kept going up and down stairs all day long to
and from my garret. This, naturally, got on everybody’s
nerves, and Martine, who is by no means the
most patient of women, was nearly beside herself
when she heard the stairs creak for the hundredth
time under my feet. If it had been summer, I
should have gone out and roamed about the country,
but as it was I had to do my roaming indoors.
It was a cold early autumn, the fields were damp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
and misty, and it rained from morning till night;
so I was shut up in the house, and not my house,
Heaven help me!</p>

<p>I hated all the furniture and ornaments, for Florimond’s
taste in such things is stupid and pretentious,
and it made me so uncomfortable that my
fingers fairly itched to move things round, or alter
them, but of course, that would never do with
the master of the house standing by, and the slightest
criticism was a mortal offense. In the dining-room
there was a ewer decorated with a simpering
lady, her tiresome lover and two cooing doves
which made me ill whenever I looked at it. I told
Florimond it made the victuals stick in my throat,
and begged him to take it away at mealtimes; but
his notion of art was ornamented confectionery
and he greatly admired this piece, so he refused, as,
of course, he had a perfect right to do; but the
faces I made amused the whole household.</p>

<p>What was to be done? Laugh at me for an old
fool? By all means; but at night, in my garret,
when the rain was on the roof, I turned and
twisted in my bed, not daring to shake the house
by walking up and down with my heavy tread.
One night as I sat up there, bare-legged, meditating
on these things, a thought came into my head
that sooner or later, by hook or by crook, I must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
rebuild my house, and after that I felt happier; but
I kept my little plan to myself and did not breathe
a word of it to my children, for I knew what they
would say.</p>

<p>“Where was the money to come from?”</p>

<p>Alas! we are no longer in the times of Orpheus
and Amphion, when stones built themselves into
walls as if to the sound of music; there is no such
charm to raise them now unless it be the chink
of money bags, and that was always faint with me
and now completely inaudible.</p>

<p>I resolved to have recourse to my friend Paillard,
though, if the truth were told, he had never offered
to lend me money; but since I took a sincere pleasure
in asking him, why should he not find equal
delight in giving me what I needed?</p>

<p>Arguing in this way, I took advantage of a comparatively
fine day and went to Dornecy. Everything
spoke of sadness; the dark hovering clouds,
the muddy ground, the damp gusts of wind swooping
like the wings of a great bird, tearing the yellow
leaves from the trees and scattering them over
the fields.</p>

<p>Paillard could hardly wait to let me get out my
first sentence before he interrupted me to complain
of the hard times, the falling off of his business,
the bad debts he had, lack of money, et<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
cetera, till I pulled him up short by asking him if
he would like me to lend him a penny piece?</p>

<p>It would be hard to say which of us was the more
irritated and hurt by this little passage at arms,
but we kept up the conversation for a while longer,
talking in a stiff unnatural way of the weather and
the crops. I could see that he was sorry for his
meanness; the poor old boy is good-hearted at
bottom and genuinely attached to me, and I knew
that he would have been delighted to lend me
money, if he had been certain that he would lose
nothing by it, and what is more he would have
yielded if I had pressed the point; but he was
not to blame, after all; he had centuries of miserly
blood in his veins, and though there may be small
householders in his position who are also open-handed,—I
say there is a legend that such people
do exist,—when you lay a finger on the purse of a
man like that, his first instinct is to say “No!”</p>

<p>At that very moment Paillard would have loved
to reconsider his refusal, but here my pride came in,
and I would make no further advances; my friend
ought to have been glad to help me out of my difficulties,
and if he thought otherwise, so much the
worse for him!</p>

<p>There we sat sulky and unhappy; he asked if I
would not stay to lunch, but I refused somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
curtly, though I could see it nearly broke his heart,
and he followed me to the door with a hang-dog
expression; but as my foot was on the threshold,
something came over me; I put my arm around his
old neck and embraced him; he did the same to
me, and there we stood without a word for a minute
or two.</p>

<p>At last he said timidly, “Colas, I could let you
have a little.”</p>

<p>“Say no more about it,” I answered, for I am
an obstinate devil.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “you will at least stay to
luncheon?”</p>

<p>So we sat down and ate heartily enough, but
nothing would have induced me to borrow of him
now; I am made like that, and if I suffered for
it this time, why so of course did he.</p>

<p>The question for me now was how to rebuild my
house without money or workmen,—but when I
get an idea in my head!</p>

<p>I ruminated over it as I walked back to Clamecy,
and the first thing I did was to go over the ruins
of my house, carefully sorting out everything that
might be of use, from the half-burnt beams to
the rusty hinges and black tottering walls.</p>

<p>One day I stole off to Chevroches to see what I
could find in the quarries among the great stone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
blocks like the bones of our earth with their red
veins. On my way through the forest, I am afraid
I helped some old oaks to sink into their final repose;
an illegal act perhaps, but one would not get
far in this world if one only did what the law
allows. The wood belonged to the town, and therefore
to me, in part at least, and of course I should
not have dreamed of taking more than my just
share; but the thing was, how to get it home? And
here the neighbors came to my assistance. One
lent me his cart, another his oxen, and a third
his tools, or rather his hands, which cost nothing.
A man will lend anything in these parts, except his
wife or his money, and I feel that way myself, for
money means the future; it is hope, all that we
have, the rest is only the present, which scarcely
belongs to us.</p>

<p>At last Robinet and I began to put up the first
scaffolding, but by that time it was cold weather,
and every one thought I was out of my mind. I
was urged to wait at least until spring, while my
children made such a pother that my life was a
burden to me.</p>

<p>In spite of all this I persisted in going on with
my work, partly because I like to rub people up the
wrong way, and then, though of course I knew
that I could not build a house all by myself in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
depths of winter, I really meant only to put up a
mere shed, a sort of rabbit hutch, where I could live
alone. I am sociable enough, but I like to choose
my own time and place, and I am also a talker, but
sometimes Breugnon seems to me the best companion
in the world, and I would walk ten miles to
get at him. It was, therefore, for the sake of
enjoying my own charming society that I was obstinately
bent on building, in spite of the opinion
of the world and the remonstrances of my children.</p>

<p>Unluckily, I was not to have the last word, for,
one frosty morning at the end of October, when the
roofs of the town and the pavements were all covered
with a thin glare of ice, I slipped on one of the
rungs of my ladder and the next thing I knew I was
lying on the ground.</p>

<p>“He has killed himself!” cried poor Binet, as he
ran to pick me up.</p>

<p>“I did it on purpose,” said I and tried to rise, but
I could not stand as my ankle was broken.</p>

<p>They fetched a stretcher and carried me home,
Martine and most of her neighbors by my side,
wringing their hands and bewailing my sad fate.
It was like an Entombment by an early master,
with the Marys surrounding the body and making
noise enough to wake Him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>I pretended to be unconscious so as to escape the
flood of pity and reproaches, but though I lay
still, with my head thrown back, and my beard
pointing to Heaven, within me I was in a proper
rage, in spite of this calm exterior.</p>

<small>PLUTARCH’S LIVES</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="right">October 30th.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> much depressed by my accident, as may be
imagined. If only the Lord had been pleased to
break any other bone in my body, I thought, but
here I was pinned by the leg! It is true that
I should have grumbled somewhat if I had broken
an arm or a rib; but now, I was ready to curse Him
for His cruelty; (Praise be to His Holy Name!)
and to swear that He had picked out the very
thing that would vex me the most.</p>

<p>He knows well that my hard-won liberty, child
not of gods, but of men, is to me as the breath of
my nostrils; dearer than gold and silver, food and
drink; and that is why He must laugh to Himself
when He sees me lying here on my back like a
beetle, staring at the beams and spider’s webs of
my garret ceiling. All the same, there is some fight
left in me, though I am tied and trussed up here
like a fowl on the spit. My body cannot stir an
inch, it is true; but how about the spirit? My free
fancies fly away on strong wings, with not a broken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
bone among them; and he had need to be swift
who would catch and stop them.</p>

<p>For the first day or two I was in an execrable
humor, and made good use of my tongue as the
only weapon I had with which to hit out at every
one, right and left; so that it was hardly safe to
come near me. The worst of all was that in my
heart I knew that my accident was entirely my
own fault; and what made it harder to bear was
that every one I saw dinned the same thing into
my ears; telling me that a man of my age had
no business to be climbing up ladders, like a fly on
a wall; reminding me that I had had ample warning,
and lamenting that I had such an obstinate
nature that good advice was thrown away on me.
The moral drawn, of course, was that I richly deserved
my fate.</p>

<p>All this naturally was extremely consoling to
me,—as if it was not bad enough to be in my miserable
condition, without being told that I was a fool
into the bargain. Martine and her husband, and
all my friends and neighbors seemed to have agreed
among themselves to harp on the same string whenever
they came to see me, while I had to lie and
listen to it all, like a helpless wild creature caught
in a trap; until I lost all patience one day, when
even my little Glodie began to sing the same tune:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
“You were a naughty Grandad to climb up ladders!”</p>

<p>I tore my nightcap off my head and threw it
at her. “Get out of this, you little beast!” I yelled;
and then I was alone, and found that, after all, I
did not like that much better.</p>

<p>After a while my daughter proposed, like the
good girl that she is, to carry my mattress down
into the room behind the shop; but I was just perverse
enough to say no, again, because I had said it
before; though by this time I was dying to give
in. On the other hand, I hated to have strangers
see me in such a state, and then Martine kept at
me like a fly, (or a woman,) and could not understand
that she talked too much about it, and so
injured her own cause. I knew also that if I yielded
I should never hear the last of it; so I told her to
let me alone, and that is what it finally came
to: they all went away and left me to myself, as
I had wished; so surely I had nothing to complain
of.</p>

<p>I had not been willing to tell my real reason,
which was, that being a dependent in that house,
I hated to give any more trouble than was necessary;
but for a man who wanted people to love
him, the stupidest thing I could have done was to
drive them all away from me; for they took me at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
my word and soon forgot me,—“Out of sight, out
of mind,”—and no one came to see me any more,
not even Glodie, though I could hear her laughing
downstairs, and smiled at the sound of it; and then
sighed, because I could not go and join in the fun
as I used to do.</p>

<p>“Ungrateful little puss,” I thought, but I knew
that I should have done the same in her place, so I
blew a kiss towards the stairs. “Have a good
time, my pretty one!”—Job lay on his dunghill,
you know, and railed at his fate, and I was somewhat
in the same position by this time.</p>

<p>One day while I was thus agreeably occupied,
old Paillard came in; he had a package in his hand,
and sat down awkwardly enough, on the foot of
my bed; while I received him in a rather crusty
manner. He began to talk of one thing and another,
but I contradicted every word he said; till at
last he was completely put out of countenance, and
sat there, clearing his throat, and tapping on the
footboard of the bed. I begged him to stop, in an
icy tone, and after that he simply did not dare to
move a finger. I could hardly help laughing, and
thought: “He reproaches himself because he
knows that if he had lent me money, I should not
have tried to build the wall, and so break my leg.
If it had not been for his meanness, none of all this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
would have happened.” And he did not know
what to say, and I would not speak, we kept silence
for some time, till at last I broke out, “Why don’t
you say something? Any one would think that I
was actually at the last gasp; but there’s no use in
sitting staring at me like a stuck pig! If you can’t
talk, go home! You do not go to see sick people
just to hold your tongue; and for goodness’ sake
stop fiddling with that book, or whatever it is you
have got there!”</p>

<p>The poor old fellow stood up. “I am going,
Colas,” he said gently. “I can see that the sight of
me puts you out, but I thought—I had brought you
this book,—<i>Lives of Celebrated Men</i>, by Plutarch;
it is translated by Jacques Amyot, Bishop of
Auxerre;—would you like it?—it might amuse you.
It would perhaps be some consolation or companionship!”
I could see that his mind was not
quite made up, for it was like drawing teeth for
him to lend his books, which he cherished even
more dearly than his ducats.</p>

<p>If any one dared touch one of the precious
volumes in his library, he was like a lover who sees
rude hands laid on the lady of his affections. I
was touched and softened by the greatness of the
sacrifice, and held out my hand to my old comrade,
telling him how grateful I was for his kindness to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
such a brute as I had shown myself to be; and I
took the book from his reluctant fingers.</p>

<p>“Take good care of it,” said he.</p>

<p>“Make your mind easy, it shall lie under my
pillow,” and with this reassuring reply I let him
depart.</p>

<p>Plutarch of Cheronæus was a stout little volume,
as broad as it was long, of about thirteen hundred
closely printed pages; the words all heaped one
upon another, like corn in a bin. “There is three
years’ provender there, for three donkeys,” thought
I. At the head of each chapter were round medallion
portraits of the illustrious subjects of the memoirs,
surrounded by wreaths of laurel; these
diverted me extremely; they only lacked a bunch
of parsley in their mouths to be complete.</p>

<p>“What are all these Greeks and Romans to me?”
I thought. “We are living, and they are long since
dead, and can teach me nothing but what I knew
before; that man is a wicked creature, but agreeable
enough; that age improves wine, and spoils
women; that in all countries, the big fishes swallow
the little ones, and the weak jeer at their oppressors.—These
Romans are terrible fellows to make
long speeches; and I am not by any means opposed
to eloquence; only I want to warn these gentlemen
that turn and turn about is fair play.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>Fluttering the leaves with a condescending
air, I threw my eyes along the pages, as an
angler draws his line along a stream, and hang
me if I did not hook something at the very first
cast. No one ever saw better fishing; the cork
went under as soon as it touched the water; and
such fish as I pulled up! Gold and silver, some
with shining scales like jewels, scattering a shower
of sparks around them; jumping and twisting, too,
with quivering fins, and flapping tails. To think
of my saying that they were dead!</p>

<p>From that day, the world might have come to an
end without my knowing what had happened; my
eye was fastened on my fishing line, waiting for a
bite. What monster am I now to draw from the
deep? Ha! look at this splendid fellow, with his
white belly and his coat of mail, changeable green
and blue, all shining in the sun. Honestly, the best
part of my life, (days, weeks, or years,—I kept no
count of them,) was spent then: and God be
thanked! who gave us eyes, through which the
wonderful visions in books can reach our brains.
Give us only those closely packed little black marks,
between the borders of the white page, and from
their sight the magician conjures up long-dispersed
armies, ruined cities, great orators of Rome, fierce
enemies, heroes and the beauties that beguile them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
the winds that blow, the sparkling sea, the hot eastern
sun, and the snows of winter.</p>

<p>Here I can see imperial Cæsar, pale and thin, reclining
in his litter surrounded by his grim old soldiers;
or that guzzler, Antony, with his dishes and
cups, on his way to some green nook, where he
and his parasites can stuff and swill to their hearts’
content; devouring eight roasted boars at one sitting.
Then Pompey passes, stiff and formal, with
Flora whom he loves;—Poliorcites decked with a
gold mantle, embroidered with the sun, moon and
stars; and Artaxerxes, like a great bull among his
herd of four hundred women.</p>

<p>Now comes Alexander, beautiful as the god
Bacchus, whose dress he wears, returning in his
triumph from India. See him high in a great car
drawn by eight horses and covered with rich carpets
and garlands of green leaves; hear the strains
of flutes and hautboys as he feasts and drinks with
his generals, all of them crowned with flowers:
women leaping about him in the dance, and his
great army at his back. Wasn’t it marvelous?
Then there was Queen Cleopatra, Lamia the flute-player,
and Statira, who was so beautiful that it
hurt your eyes to look at her! In spite of Antony,
Alexander, and Artaxerxes, all these enchantresses
are mine, now at my pleasure. I can enter their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
bowers, drink with Thaïs, embrace Roxana, and
carry Cleopatra away in my arms wrapped in her
carpet. It is possible for me even to imitate
Antiochus, who was in love with his mother-in-law,
although that is a singular idea to my
notion.</p>

<p>I go out to exterminate the Gauls; I come, I see,
I conquer; and the best of it all is that it does not
cost me one single drop of blood! Then, too, my
riches are beyond counting; each story is a caravel,
laden with the treasures of the East or Barbary;
bringing precious metals, old wines, strange beasts,
and captured slaves of the rarest beauty:—such
breasts, such ivory limbs! All this is mine, these
empires rose, flourished and disappeared, only to
give me pleasure. I feel as if I were at a Carnival,
where in turn I can wear every man’s mask and disguise,
even to putting on his skin, and with it his
thoughts and passions. Thus I am at once the
music, and the dancer, the book and old Plutarch,
who was inspired to write it in a most fortunate
hour.</p>

<p>How good it is to let the rhythm of words and
phrases carry you off, dancing and laughing, into
space, free from all trammels of the body. This
mind, this thought of ours is God Himself. Praise
be to His Holy Spirit!—Sometimes I pause in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
midst of the story to imagine how it will turn out,
and then compare my own fancy with the image
which nature or art had created. In the case of
art, I am so sharp that I can generally guess right;
and then how I laugh at my own cleverness! But
the old witch, life, is often too much for me!—her
resources are beyond our feeble comprehension.
There is only one part of the tale which she never
troubles herself to vary; all her stories end in the
same way—wit, war, love—you know what happens
to them—they disappear into the darkness;
and on this one point she certainly does repeat
herself.</p>

<p>She is like a naughty child, breaking her toys
when she is tired of them, till I am provoked to
blame her for being so destructive, and snatch the
pieces out of her hands; but it is too late; they
are broken past repair; and all that I can do, is to
cherish what is left, as Glodie rocks the remains
of her doll in her arms.</p>

<p>At each revolution of the dial this Death comes
nearer and nearer, like a beautiful refrain: “Strike
hour! ring bells, ding dong ding.” Now, I fancy
myself Cyrus, Emperor of Persia, Conqueror of
Asia; hear what I say:—“Friend, envy me not the
small space of earth, which covers my poor body.”—I
stand beside Alexander as he reads this epitaph<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
and trembles, for in it he seems to hear his own
voice rising from the tomb.</p>

<p>Now that you are dead, great Cyrus and Alexander,
how near you both seem to me; do I dream?
or are they really there? I pinch myself to find out
if I am awake, yes, there on the table by my side
are two coins which I dug up in my vineyard last
year, with the profiles of bearded Commodus
dressed as Hercules, and Crispina Augusta, with
her heavy chin and her shrewish nose.—“This is
no dream,” say I; “for here is Rome between my
thumb and forefinger.”</p>

<p>My greatest pleasure was to lose myself in reflections
on moral issues; to raise once more, questions
long settled by force; should I cross the Rubicon,—or
not? I could never make up my mind! I fought
Brutus and Cæsar in turn; changed my opinion
and argued on either side with so much eloquence
that I could not tell what I believed. In this way
the subject takes possession of you, as you give
and take, strike out and hit back, till at last you are
transfixed by your own blade! Did you ever hear
of such an idea? But it all comes of reading Plutarch,
with his smooth tongue, and pleasant way
of calling you “my friend”! He gets you first on
one side and then on the other; and has as many
points of view as he has stories to tell you; so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
the hero I love best is always the last one that I
have read about.</p>

<p>We are all chained to Fortune’s car; her triumphs
over history are greater than Pompey’s, as
her wheel turns, never resting for a moment. She
has as many phases as the moon, says Menelaus, in
the words Sophocles puts into his mouth; and for
those who are still in her first quarter, that is a
comforting reflection.</p>

<p>I would sometimes say to myself: “What does
all this matter, Breugnon? What to you are the
glories of Rome, and the crimes and follies of these
old rascals? You have your own faults and troubles
to think of, why go out of your way to worry
over those of people who have been dead and gone
for eighteen hundred years? To a sober middle-class
citizen of Clamecy, Cæsar, Antony, and their
light-o’-love, Cleopatra, these Persian princes who
murdered their sons and married their daughters,
were extremely depraved people; the most virtuous
thing they ever did was to die; so peace to their
ashes!—but how can a respectable man find pleasure
in reading about such insanities? Think of
Alexander, who spent the treasures of a nation on
the burial of his beautiful favorite, Ephestion. Are
you not shocked by such extravagance?—It is bad
enough to murder a lot of people, for men are savage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
beasts; but when it comes to wasting so much
good money, that these tyrants had never earned,
how can you smile at such wickedness? It is really
absurd to see you sitting up with your eyes wide
open, as proud as if you yourself had been fool
enough to scatter these millions to the wind. Surely
the worst idiot of all is he who delights in the follies
of others!”</p>

<p>After a discourse of this kind, the other side of
me would make answer: “Colas, you talk like a
printed book, but, none the less, I would give my
right hand for these things which you call nonsense;
and I find more life in the shadows of the
men who died two thousand years ago, than in
those who move and breathe today. I feel that I
know and love them, and would consent to let
Alexander kill me as he did Clytus, if afterward
he would come and weep over my body. It is all
real to me; my heart is in my throat when I see
Cæsar in the Senate-house, his back against a pillar
like a stag at bay, the conspirators’ knives searching
for his life; and I am in ecstasy when Cleopatra
floats by me in her gilded barge, surrounded by
Nereids and young pages, naked and beautiful as
the day. The perfumed breeze blows across my
face, and I open my big nostrils, the better to inhale
the delicious fragrance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>When at the end Antony is drawn up to the loophole
in the tower, bleeding, half dead; and his love,
struggling with the heavy weight, can hardly pull
him in;—I really cannot bear it, and sob like a
child! What is it that moves me thus, and binds
me to these men and women as if to those of my
own blood? except the fact that we are truly of one
family, we are Man, each and all of us.</p>

<p>I pity people from the bottom of my heart who
know nothing of the profound pleasure of books;
they are like disinherited children, but they do not
know it, and boast that the present is enough
for them. Blind geese! who can see no farther
than the end of their noses! Not that I mean to
deny the merits of the present; that would come
with an ill grace from one like me, who have always
kept my hands and my mouth open for anything
good. No, those who find fault with the
present are ignorant, or else they have a poor
digestion: I understand a man who clasps all that
he can reach to his heart, but there are those
who reach nothing worth while:—he who contents
himself with little is of small value; and I have always
preferred to take the most that I could get
in life.</p>

<p>In Adam’s time the present was all very well;
there were no clothes to wear, and only one woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
in the world; but life is fuller now, coming as we
do at the end of a long line of ancestors, heirs to
all that they have amassed, and we should be fools
indeed to neglect the harvests of the past, on the
pretext that we can gather others.</p>

<p>I often dwell on the thought of Adam. He and
I are really the same person, only I am older and
bigger; the same tree, but with more branches. I
feel every stroke of the woodman’s axe to my remotest
leaf; all the joys and sorrows of the world
are mine; I laugh with them that rejoice, and weep
with them that weep; and this is especially true
of the world of books; there, more than in my own
life, I feel the bond that unites men, from prince
to peasant.</p>

<p>Soon of us all there will remain only a few ashes,
and the flame which rises, one yet infinitely multiplied,
from our inmost souls towards Heaven.
There with its thousand tongues it will sing forever
the glory of the Omnipotent Creator.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>So I lie dreaming in my garret, while outside
the wind falls with the fading light, and the chill
wings of the snow brush across the window panes.
As the shadows darken my eyes can no longer distinguish
the book in my hand, but with my face
on the page the human scent comes to my nostrils;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
is it I, or the story that is dying away into the
night, that comes, that is here? I am in the forest,
my prey eludes me in the long vistas, as I seem
to stop and listen with a beating heart to the flight
and the pursuit: my eyes slowly close, but they can
pierce through the darkness; I am not asleep, the
planets are looking at me through the window, I
can almost touch the glass, and across the black
arch without flashes one shooting star, then another,—a
rain of jewels this November night; and
I think of Cæsar and his comet,—perhaps that is
the trail of his blood up yonder!</p>

<p>At dawn I am still there dreaming. It is Sunday;
I hear the church bells, and their sound fills
the whole house from cellar to garret with its vibrations,
giving new life to my vagrant fancies,
which spread themselves over poor old Paillard’s
book. To my ear my dim little chamber resounds
to the feet of armies, the wheels of chariots, and
the tramp of war-steeds. The windows shake, my
ears and my heart thrill with the sound, and I open
my mouth to cry: “Ave Cæsar Imperator!”—when
Florimond, who has come up and is looking
out of the window, says with a loud yawn: “There
is not a single soul to be seen in the street this
morning,—it is as dull as ditch-water!”</p>

<small>HEALTH TO THE KING!</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="right">St. Martin’s Day,<br>
November 11th.&#160;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> air was delightfully soft and warm when I
woke this morning; it seemed like a gentle touch
on my cheek, or a kitten rubbing itself against me.
It flowed in a golden stream through the window;
the sky had raised her cloudy eyelids, and looked
at me with her pale blue eyes, while a faint ray of
sunshine smiled from the opposite roof.</p>

<p>I felt dreamy and languid and like a boy again,—old
fool that I am! But I have stopped growing
old and am now retracing my steps as fast as I
can; pretty soon I shall be an infant in arms once
more. My heart was filled with sweet visions,—like
good Roger who yearned for Alcine,—you remember?
I was in such a tender humor that I
could not have been persuaded to harm a fly, and
any child could have played with me.</p>

<p>I thought I was alone, but all at once I caught
sight of Martine in the corner; I had not noticed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
when she came in, for she had said nothing, contrary
to her habit, but just sat down and took up
her sewing without even looking in my direction.
I felt on such good terms with all the world that
I wanted to share my pleasure, so just for the sake
of being amiable, I said, “Why did they ring the
great bell this morning?”</p>

<p>“It is St. Martin’s Day, Father,” said she, surprised
at the question.</p>

<p>To think that I should have so lost myself in
dreams as to forget the god of our town and herself!
Among all the new friends in Plutarch, I
could see in my mind’s eye this old one, as good
as any of the rest of them, dividing his long cloak
with his sword, as his legend tells us. “How could
I forget St. Martin?” cried I.</p>

<p>“I don’t know indeed,” said Martine, “except
that these days you don’t seem to remember anything
in earth or Heaven but that stupid book of
yours.”</p>

<p>This made me laugh, for I had often noticed that
she cast a malevolent eye on old Plutarch when
she came in the morning and found him in my bed;
women seldom have a real love for books; they see
in them either lovers or rivals. When they themselves
read they always have an uneasy sense of
infidelity, and that is why they cannot bear to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
us absorbed in books, which they feel to be a sort
of treachery.</p>

<p>“It is St. Martin’s own fault,” said I, “he never
comes to see me nowadays, though he has half his
cloak to wear, and so I forgot all about him. Out
of sight out of mind! You must keep yourself
before people’s eyes, you know, my daughter, if
you want to be remembered.”</p>

<p>“There is no need to tell me that; I don’t let
folks forget me.”</p>

<p>“True enough, you are easy to see and hear as
a general thing, but this morning you were as
still as a mouse; I miss our usual quarrel, come
over here and begin.”</p>

<p>She would not even turn her head, but answered,
“I have given up, there is no use talking to
you!”</p>

<p>I looked at her as she sat stitching away with
her mouth obstinately set; she really looked sad,
so I began to be sorry that I had got the better of
her. “Come here, dear, and give me a kiss; I may
forget Martin, but never his namesake. Come, I
have a present here for you.”</p>

<p>“You have some trick up your sleeve.”</p>

<p>“No, no, on my word, come and see what I have
for you.”</p>

<p>“I am too busy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>“Unnatural child, you are too busy to kiss your
old father?”</p>

<p>She came reluctantly and stood near the bed, and
I held out my arms to her.</p>

<p>“I don’t see any present,” said she.</p>

<p>“You have it now, I meant myself.”</p>

<p>“A pretty present you would be!”</p>

<p>“Ugly or pretty, I am yours entirely now to
do with as you please.”</p>

<p>“Will you sleep downstairs?”</p>

<p>“Anywhere you choose to put me.”</p>

<p>“Will you do as you are told and let me love you
and scold you when you need it?”</p>

<p>“I am your slave from this hour!”</p>

<p>“You dear bad old thing!” she cried. “I am
going to get even with you now, for all your obstinacy!”</p>

<p>Then she hugged and cuffed me, shaking me
about like a doll, and, without waiting a minute,
called Florimond and his white-capped assistants
who carried me feet first down the narrow stair
and put me down in the big bed in the bright room,
and there Martine and Glodie tucked me up and
fussed about me, telling me over and over again
that now that they had me downstairs I should see
what good care they would take of me.</p>

<p>Do you know I really enjoyed it? And, having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
given in to my daughter completely, strangely
enough I find that it is I who really direct and
manage the whole household.</p>

<p>Martine spends the greater part of the day in my
room now and we have long talks about one time in
particular when <i>I</i> sat by <i>her</i> bedside, because it was
she who was laid up with a sprained foot. The
naughty little cat had jumped out of the window
one night to meet her sweetheart; I caught her,
and in spite of the sprain, I gave her a good trouncing;
she laughs at it now and says I did not hurt
enough, but in those days it was impossible to keep
her in order no matter what you did; she always
managed to slip through my fingers, but she kept
her head nevertheless and some one else lost his,
we must suppose, as he is now her husband. She
laughs and sighs over those old days, and says it
is all over now; that there are no more jokes for
her; and then we talk of Florimond. She does justice
to his good qualities, like the sensible woman
that she is, but admits that he does not amuse her;
marriage, however, is not intended for an amusement.</p>

<p>“No one knows that better than you do, Father,
but we must make the best of what we have. You
might as well try to draw water out of a sieve as
to look for love in a husband, but I am not one to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
cry my eyes out for what I cannot have; I am
not so badly off, and contented enough on the
whole; but I can’t help thinking how different
things are now from what I used to expect. How
far our youthful dreams are from the things we
come to accept in later years! I don’t know if it is
sad or ridiculous, but when I remember all the
hopes and fears, vows and flames, and for what?
To make some man’s pot boil. After all, it is as
much as most of us deserve, but if any one had
told me so, once upon a time!—Well, there is always
some fun to be got out of it. Laughter is a
sauce that would make anything taste good, and
that has never been lacking to you and me, Daddy;
we can always laugh when we have made fools of
ourselves.”</p>

<p>Such as it was, you can be sure we did not deny
ourselves that consolation, and had many a joke,
too, at the expense of other people. Sometimes
we would fall silent; she occupied with her work
and I with my book; but we kept up a little murmur
like a brook which flows underground till it
can leap out again into the sunshine; an idea would
come into Martine’s head which made her burst
out laughing, and then our tongues would run on
again faster than ever.</p>

<p>I should have been glad to introduce Plutarch to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
Martine, and make her appreciate all his beauties,
and enjoy my interesting and pathetic manner of
reading aloud, but I had no sort of success; she did
not like Greece or Rome any more than a fish
would like apples for his dinner. Sometimes she
would listen for a few moments, just from politeness,
but she could not keep her mind on it, or
rather her thoughts were elsewhere, flying up,
down and all around, so that at the most exciting
part of the narrative when I was working up to my
effect, with a trembling voice, she would interrupt
me, calling out to Glodie, or to Florimond at the
other end of the house. This vexed me, of course,
but I had to give it up, and resign myself to the fact
that woman rarely shares our visions with us. She
is half of us, but which half? The upper, of
course, but suppose it should be the other? One
thing is very sure, whatever the sexes have in common,
it is not their brain, for each has its own,
like a case full of baubles; or rather, they are like
two sprouts from the same stem with one root between
them—the heart.</p>

<p>I have a great many visitors these days, old
graybeard as I am, ruined and lame into the bargain;
all the pretty young housewives of the neighborhood
gather round my bed, ostensibly to bring
me the news, or to ask to have something mended.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
It does not matter what excuse they make for
coming, they forget all about it as soon as they
are inside the door; it is like the market, where
each one has her place; Guillemine the bright-eyed,
Huguette with her straight nose, clever
Jacquotte, Margueron, Alizon, and all the rest of
them, and the old man in the middle, snug under
his down comforter. Such gossiping and such a
clack of tongues, with their gay laughter ringing
out like bells—mine is the big deep one. I know
a lot of good stories which hit the girls in the right
spot, and they laugh sometimes till they roll on
the floor, and you can hear them across the
street.</p>

<p>Florimond was actually jealous of my popularity,
and wanted me to tell him the secret of my success.
I said that it was an open secret; I was
young, that was all; but he said rather spitefully
that he knew that it was because I had such a
bad reputation, as women always like a rake.</p>

<p>“True enough,” said I, “you know how boys
admire an old soldier, when he comes back from
the field of glory, and in the same way the ladies
like Colas because they understand each other;
they think he has fought in the campaigns of Love,
and may perhaps live to fight another day.”</p>

<p>“Did any one ever hear such an old wretch?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
cried Martine, “to be talking of making love at his
time of life!”</p>

<p>“Why not? Now that you have put the idea
into my head, I have a great mind to marry again.”</p>

<p>“Much good may it do you! But, after all, boys
will be boys!”</p>

<p class="right">December 6th. &#160;<br>
St. Nicholas Day,</p>

<p>I got out of bed this morning to do honor to the
anniversary, and they rolled my great armchair
between the table and the window, set a foot-warmer
under my feet, and placed a little desk
before me, with a socket for the candle.</p>

<p>About ten o’clock appeared the brotherhood of
sailors, boat-builders, and workmen on the river.
First came their players and the banner, and then
they all passed by our windows arm in arm, dancing
and singing, on their way to church, perhaps
to the wineshop later. They saw me and stopped
to cheer, so I stood up, and my patron saint and I
exchanged salutations. Then I leaned down and
shook as many of their black paws as I could
reach, and poured a drop or two into each of the
big mouths, though it was like trying to sprinkle a
field.</p>

<p>My four sons came at twelve o’clock to offer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
me the compliments of the season, for no matter
on what terms one lives for the rest of the year, a
father’s name-day is sacred; the whole family life
revolves around it as on a pivot; it is a bond which
draws us all together, and I attach a great deal
of importance to it. I don’t know that the four
enjoyed themselves much when they were all there
together, for in fact I am the only real tie between
them, as they have but little love for each other.</p>

<p>It is a sign of our times, this relaxation of those
ties between men, the home, family, and religion;
each trusts in his own wisdom now, and wants to
live for himself alone. I am not one of those old
men who are always grumbling and complaining
of the present day, and predicting disaster; I know
that the world will outlast my time, and that the
young know their own business as well as ever
their fathers did. Yes, but the old have a hard part
to play where all around them is change and renewal;
they must alter too or there is no room for
them, and that is precisely what I do not want to
do. I prefer to sit here in my chair just as I am;
the only thing I am willing to change is my mind,
and only that when it is absolutely necessary. I
can turn my ideas inside out, but they are the same
thing after all, and meanwhile I can look on at the
shifting scenes and the young people whom I admire,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
but none the less I lie in wait for the chance
to guide them in the way I would have them go.</p>

<p>When we all gathered round the dinner table
I had at my right hand John Francis, who is a
bigoted Catholic; on my left, my son Anthony
from Lyons, who is an equally bigoted Huguenot.
They sat up stiffly on their chairs, staring straight
before them, so as not to be obliged to look at one
another.</p>

<p>John Francis is a smiling prosperous man with a
hard shrewd eye; he talked interminably of his
business, boasted of his money and of the fine linen
that he sold by the special favor of Providence.
Anthony’s lips are shaved but he wears a little
beard on his chin; and is morose and cold in his
manner. He also talked of his trade in books, his
journeys to Geneva, his affairs generally, and attributed
his prosperity to God, but it seemed to be
a different Deity. Neither listened, but kept on
monotonously repeating the same refrain, until at
last they became annoyed and began to introduce
topics of a controversial nature, one dwelling on
the progress of <i>The</i> Religion, the other on the stability
of <i>The</i> True Faith; all the time each ignored
his antagonist, sat as if nailed to his seat, and spoke
with the utmost contempt, and in a sharp rasping
voice, of the enemies’ God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>In the middle of the table sat my son Michael,
sergeant in the Sacermore regiment; he is called a
rascal, but is not a bad fellow on the whole, and
the behavior of his brothers diverted him extremely,
sending him into fits of laughter. He kept
turning from one to the other, like an animal in a
cage, to stare into the angry faces of his elders,
and at last interrupted them without ceremony,
telling them that they were fat sheep of the same
breed even if their fleece was marked with a different
brand, and that he had seen plenty of their sort
killed and eaten.</p>

<p>The youngest son Anisse sat and gazed at him
with horror. His name was certainly well chosen,
for he never could have invented gunpowder; discussions
are his abhorrence, for he takes no real
interest in anything on earth; his only joy is to
yawn and dawdle throughout the livelong day.
Politics and religion seem to him diabolical inventions
to disturb the sleep of sensible men. “Good
or bad,” he would say, “what I have is enough for
me, so why change it? Why turn over the mattress
when I made the hole in the middle myself?”
Poor fellow! people will persist in shaking up his
feather-bed whether he likes it or not, which angers
him so much that, mild as he is, he would like to
send his disturbers to instant execution. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
brothers’ loud voices positively scared him, making
him duck his head as if to avoid a blow.</p>

<p>I was all eyes and ears as I sat there taking them
in, and it amused me to unravel the part of myself
that was in each of my four sons, for mine they
are beyond a doubt. If something in them came
out of me, it must have gone into me at one time
or another, but I do not find anywhere in my skin a
trace of the preacher, the priest, or the sheep. (Perhaps
I might discover the adventurer if I looked
closely.) But the germs must have been there, and
Nature has betrayed me. Yes, I can recognize my
own gestures and ways of speaking, even of thinking.
I can see myself in these men, but disguised,
and that is what is rather confusing; but underneath
it is the very same person, one and various.
We each contain many personalities, good, bad and
indifferent, the wolf, the lamb, the watch-dog, the
honest man and the scamp, but one of the number
is sure to be the strongest, and dominates all the
rest, who escape as soon as they can by the first
open door.</p>

<p>I am filled with self-reproach when I see these
escaped sons of mine, so remote, yet so near to me.
My little boys they must always be too, and even
when they are most foolish, I feel that I ought to
apologize to them, for is it not all my fault? Luckily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
enough they are perfectly contented and satisfied
with themselves, and that is as it should be,
but their intolerance is what I cannot bear. Why
cannot they live, and let others live, in peace? There
they were, all four, like so many fighting-cocks,
ready to peck and jump at each other, but by this
time I had had enough of it, and observed placidly,
“Well, my lambs, I see that it would not be easy
to pull the wool from your backs, and I am proud to
see you show your good blood,—mine, I mean,—and
make yourselves heard, but now be still, all of
you, and let me have a chance to talk, for I have
something I have been dying to say for the last half
hour.”</p>

<p>Far from obeying me on the instant, some chance
word excited them so that they broke into a perfect
storm of rage; John Francis caught up a chair, Michael
drew his long sword, and Anthony a dagger,
while Anisse employed his only weapon by bleating,
“Murder! Fire!” in a lamentable voice.</p>

<p>Upon my honor I was afraid that they would
cut each other’s throats, but I seized the first thing
that came to my hand (unluckily it was the ewer
with the doves, pride of Florimond’s heart), and
dashed it in fragments on the table. The noise
checked the combatants, and at the same moment,
Martine ran in with a pot of boiling water and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
threatened to sprinkle it over them if they did not
stop fighting. They still clamored and disputed,
but when I raise my voice, other donkeys have to
cease braying.</p>

<p>“I am master here,” I cried, “and I tell you I
will have no more of this. Shut up! Are you all
crazy, or do you take this for the Council of Nicea?
If you want subjects to discuss, pick out something
of our own day, for I am bored to death with your
old quarrels. If the doctor has ordered you to dispute
by way of exercise, you can wrangle over the
merits of these wines, the food on the table, or anything
you can see or touch, and then there will be
some way to decide the controversy; but to differ
about the Holy Ghost, or the mind of God, is as
much as to say that you have no minds of your
own. I am not opposed to faith; I believe, he believes,
you believe, as much as you please, but
don’t let us talk so much about it. There are plenty
of other interesting topics in the world, and, since
each of you is perfectly sure to go to Heaven, with a
place reserved for you, and all the people who differ
from you barred out, let us be happy meanwhile,
and leave the good Lord to arrange His household
as seems good to Him. Surely He is able to look
after His own affairs without assistance from us;
He reigns in Heaven, and we on earth; our business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
is to make it as habitable a place as possible,
and to that end we must all do our share; not one
of us can be spared; even you four can be useful in
your day and generation. Your country needs
your faith, John Francis, as much as yours, Anthony;
Michael’s adventurous spirit and Anisse’s
stay-at-home qualities are equally valuable; for you
are the four pillars of the house, and if one gives
way, the whole building falls to the ground, and
will overwhelm you all in ruin. Surely you must
be convinced by such masterly reasoning, and will
agree that you do not wish anything so unnecessary.
What would you think of sailors in a storm
at sea if they fell to disputing instead of taking in
sail?</p>

<p>“I will tell you a story about King Henry and
our late Duke. They were lamenting the warlike
disposition of the French nation which led to perpetual
civil wars. ‘Ventresaintgris!’ exclaimed
the King, ‘but I should like to take these furious
monks and preachers of the Gospel, sew them up in
a sack like a litter of cats, and throw them into the
Loire!’ The Duke replied that he had heard there
was an island where the rulers of Berne sent quarrelsome
husbands and wives; when a boat returned
for them a month later, it found the couple cooing
like a pair of turtle doves. ‘I should like to tie our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
rival religionists up in bundles and pack them off to
that isle, hoping for the same result,’ concluded
his lordship, laughing.</p>

<p>“Now, my children,” said I, “you need the same
kind of treatment. Why do you grunt and turn
your backs on each other? Each of you may think
himself of finer clay than his brothers, but the
fact is you are all Breugnons, chips of the old block,
thorough-bred Burgundians. You all have big
crooked noses, and wide mouths like wine-funnels;
your eyes look out fiercely from under bushy eyebrows,
but there is a twinkle in them all the same.
The artist’s signature is plain to see on the four of
you, so can’t you understand that if you hurt your
brothers, you are injuring yourself as well? That
it is for your own interest to be united? What if
you don’t think alike on some questions? That is
rather an advantage than otherwise, for you cannot
all plow the same field; on the contrary, the more
fields and opinions there are in the family, the
greater our strength and happiness. Reach out
then into the world as far as you possibly can, and
increase your portion of land and thought. Each
for himself and all for each, and may the long
Breugnon nose point the way to the future glory of
the family! Come, boys, shake hands and be
friends!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>For a moment they still looked sulkily at each
other, but I could see the clouds parting, and all at
once Michael flung his arms round John Francis,
with a loud laugh, “Embrace me, Brother-Big-Nose!”
cried he, and the others followed his example.</p>

<p>“Come, Martine, let us drink to the Breugnon
brothers ourselves!!”</p>

<p>A few moments before, when I broke the ewer
in my anger, I had cut my wrist a little, and left
a little blood on the table. Anthony held his glass
under the scratch in his pompous manner, and
caught a drop.</p>

<p>“Let this wine from our father’s veins be the
seal of our reconciliation.”</p>

<p>“What a disgusting idea!” I cried; “to think of
spoiling good wine with such a mixture! Throw it
away, and if you want to drink my blood, you’ll find
it in a bottle of the best!” and thereupon we all
drank and all agreed as to the vintage.</p>

<p>When they had gone and Martine was binding
up my wrist, she said slyly, “You succeeded at last,
you old scamp, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Succeeded in what? In stopping the quarrel?”</p>

<p>“You know well enough what I mean,” and she
pointed to the broken fragments of the ewer on the
table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>I pretended not to understand, and, with the
most innocent expression, declared that I had not
the least idea what she meant, but I could not help
laughing, and she boxed my ears for an old
rascal.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t stand the sight of it another minute,”
I said, “it was really too hideous; either that ewer
or I had to perish!”</p>

<p>“The one that remains is none too handsome.”</p>

<p>“That does not trouble me, you know, for I don’t
have to look at him.”</p>

<p class="right">Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>Now as the winter draws on the shortening days
are like precious stuffs folded away into the coffer
of the nights, only to reappear, already growing
longer, on St. Lucy’s Day. The seasons have
turned once more on their well-oiled hinges, the
door has shut and opened again, and through the
crack the new year begins to shine.</p>

<p>As I sit this Christmas Eve under the great chimney-hood,
I am as it were at the bottom of a well,
and can look up and see the bright stars winking in
the sky, and from far off comes the sound of the
bells ringing for midnight mass. I love to think
that the Child was born at this dead hour when all
the world was still. His voice speaks to us of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
coming day and of the New Year, and Hope, with
her warm wings, broods over the frozen night and
softens it.</p>

<p>My children have all gone to church, but I have
missed it for the first time in my life, and I am here
alone with my dog Citron, and the household cat
Patapon. A little while ago we were all gathered
round the hearth, and I was telling Glodie wonderful
fairy tales. You should see her open her
round eyes at the story of Bout-de-Canard and the
little bald chicken, or of the boy who made a fortune
out of his cock by selling it to people who
wanted to know when the day was coming, so that
they could carry it away in their carts. It was too
amusing to see her, and the others listening and
laughing, every one putting in his word.</p>

<p>Sometimes when we were silent for a minute we
could hear the water bubbling in the kettle, a log
falling in the fire, the cricket’s shrill voice, and, outside,
the wind sweeping against the window. I
love these snug winter evenings, the silence, the
sense of intimacy, when my fancies can wander far
afield and return safe to the home nest.</p>

<p>I have been making up my budget for the last
year, and I find that in six months I have lost all
that I possessed; my wife, my house, my money,
and my legs; and yet, absurd as it sounds to say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
so, on striking a balance, I find myself as rich as
ever. How can that be, when I have nothing?</p>

<p>No burdens, would be nearer the truth; for I
find myself lightened of care, happier, freer than
the wind that blows; I would not have believed it,
if, last year, any one had predicted what would
happen and that I should take it in this spirit. I
had always sworn that whatever came, to the day
of my death, I would be master in my own house,
independent, owing nothing to any one but myself.
Well, we do not know what a day will bring forth.
Things turn out so differently from what we intended,
and we are nevertheless content.</p>

<p>Man is a wonderful creature and all is grist that
comes to his mill. Happiness, suffering, feast or
famine, he can adjust himself to any of them. He
can go on four legs or on one; he may be deaf,
dumb or blind, he will still manage to get along,
and see, hear and speak in the depths of his own
soul. Everything is shaped and formed by that
soul of his, and how delightful it is to have such
a mind and body! To feel that if need be one can
swim like a fish, fly like a bird, bathe in fire like
a salamander, or wrestle successfully with all four
elements as man does on the ground. In this way
we gain through our losses, for our minds can
supply what has been taken away, so that the less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
we have the more we are, as a pruned tree grows
stronger and more beautiful.</p>

<p>The clock strikes midnight.</p>

<p>Hark to the Christmas hymn, “Unto us a Child
is born.”</p>

<p class="right">Epiphany.</p>

<p>It really is a joke how I keep on adding to my
possessions now that I have nothing at all, and the
secret is that I have learned to enjoy the riches of
others, and so have none of the drawbacks.</p>

<p>I have read horrid stories of poor old fathers
who stripped themselves of all their goods for their
children’s sake, and then found themselves neglected
and forlorn, conscious that their wicked offspring
already wished them dead and buried. I
can only say that these unfortunate old men must
have mismanaged the whole thing, and, for my
part, I have never been so well looked after, so
much loved and petted as I am now in my poverty.</p>

<p>I kept some things from my prosperous days
which are better than gold and silver. I have my
good spirits still, and lots more treasures that I
picked up in the course of my life; gaiety and
sharpness, wisdom and folly. I have enough for all
comers, so if my children give me a good deal, they
get something back, and if the account does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
balance evenly, we throw in affection for good
measure.</p>

<p>If you would like to see an uncrowned King, a
landless but happy man, look at Breugnon as he
sits throned tonight at the merry feast of the
Epiphany. There was a great procession in the
afternoon which went by our windows; the three
Magi with their attendants, a chorus of shepherds
and shepherdesses, and all the dogs in the town;
now in the evening we are all gathered round the
table, thirty of us, including me, children, and
grandchildren; and they all drank my health together,
crying, “Here’s to the King!” for they
have crowned me with a splendid paper crown,
and Martine is my queen; (you see, like those old
fellows in Plutarch, I have married my daughter)
so whenever I carry my glass to my lips, every one
applauds; and then I laugh and the wine goes down
the wrong way. My queen not only shares my
drink herself, but there is another person who
shares too in his own way, and that is my youngest
grandson, who lies in his mother’s arms, red and
squalling. Every one is happy down to the dog
and cat picking up bones under the table.</p>

<p>I hate to keep my thoughts to myself, so I say
aloud:</p>

<p>“The only fault I have to find with this good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
life of ours, my friends, is that it is too short. I
don’t feel as if I had had my money’s worth, and
though I may be told that I ought to be satisfied
with what has fallen to my lot, I can only say that
I should like to have more, a second slice of cake,
if I could get it without making too much fuss.
And then it makes me unhappy to think of all the
good fellows who are gone. Of what use is it to be
here alone? Ah, how Time flows on, and with it
good men like King Henry and our Duke Louis!”</p>

<p>The thought of them was enough to set me off,
on former times and recollections, and I told old
stories till, I am sorry to say, I grew tired and
began to repeat myself; but my children did not
mind, and when I became confused and forgot anything,
they would fill up the gap; and then I would
pull myself together and find them all laughing.</p>

<p>“Well, Father, those were great days when you
were young! What figures the women must have
had, and what splendid fellows the men were! As
for King Henry and his friend the Duke, they have
not their equal nowadays!”</p>

<p>“All right,” I reply, “laugh and grow fat. I
know there is still good fish in the sea, and good
men to catch it, and for one that goes, three will
come after. There will never be a lack of good
stout sons of Gaul, but my trouble is that they will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
not be the same ones that I knew and loved, like
King Henry who is gone; but never mind, Colas,
there is nothing to cry about. I should think not
indeed! for you surely don’t want to keep on chewing
the same cud for ever. The wine is just as
good even if it is not out of the old casks, and here’s
to the King and his people!</p>

<p>“Frankly, dear children, I love myself better
than any King, so liberty for us, my countrymen!
and to the devil with our rulers! As long as we are
here, the land I love, and I, all is well; so what need
have we of a King on earth or in Heaven? Or of
a throne for him to sit on? Let each man have his
share of the sun and shade, his bit of land, and his
arms to work with, no one could ask more; and if
the King in person came to my house I would say,
‘Come in and sit down, for we are all equal together
in France, each master in his own kingdom,
and here’s to your good health, my guest and
cousin.’”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“How is this?” said Brother John, “art thou
also a poet?—By the help of God, I can string
rhymes together as well as another; I am sure of
it; have but patience with me if my verses should
prove of the wrong color——”</p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
